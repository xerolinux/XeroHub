## 🧪 Demo Version

Curious to try it out first? Grab the **Demo ISO** for free. This demo is designed for testing only [**More Info**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/distro/#free-demo) :

- Runs as a Live Environment with no installer.
- Uses a small 100MiB cow-space (RAM-based overlay).
- Installing drivers or other software requiring a reboot won’t work.
- System changes will not persist after reboot (non-persistent environment).

Perfect for exploring the interface, checking hardware compatibility, and previewing the custom setup with **zero commitment**.

### Support Me / My Cause

If you want to see our projects thrive and continue, please do consider supporting them. Without your support none of this would have been possible. I thank every one of you who have pleged a few pennies here n there.

So, if you want to support me financially, there are 2 ways to do so currently. You can either do it via [**Ko-Fi**](https://ko-fi.com/xerolinux) or by becoming a [**Github-Sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/xerolinux)

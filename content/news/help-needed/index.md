Hey there...

This is a new type of post. Please read on to understand what it's all about. **XeroLinux** urgently needs your help.

### Designers needed

We here, at the **XeroLinux HQ** are looking for designers who will help us bring life to our upcoming **Merch Store**. Yes, you read this right, we are looking to expand our portfolio, adding cool merch that everyone can purchase, as an alternative or additional way to support the project.

I am no designer, nor do I have a high quality logo to start with, just a very low quality one, maybe it can be used for inspiration. Also I am not looking at offering every type of item under the sun, just a few that might be interesting to the **FOSS** oriented crowd.

### Service Chosen

The service I have chosen is [**FourthWall**](https://fourthwall.com). I chose this one because Matt from [**TheLinuxCast**](https://thelinuxcast.org) recommended it, and I trust his choice. I am new to all this, so I have **NO** idea what am doing. That's why your help is needed.

I have already set up the domain, and added a few basic items with my logo, so now all that's missing is more high quality merch lol. However it's a good start I guess. So if you can help add more and have some cool FOSS meme ideas we can print, let me know.

### Compensation

Well, since I am based in Lebanon, it will be very difficult for me to compensate you directly for any services rendered. However we can always reach some sort of understading. We will dicuss this behind the scenes.

### Wrapping up

So now that you know what I am looking for, and are interested, feel free to contact me either on [**Fosstodon**](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) or by emailing me directly via this [**E-mail**](mailto:techxero@vivaldi.net?subject=XeroLinux%20Merch%20Design). I am looking forward to our collab should it happen.

Cheers !

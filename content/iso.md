As you can see, after thinking long and hard, I have decided to revive the Distro. Only this time it's a bit different.

**Notice :** Check out the release notes and issues >> [**Here**](https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev/xero-build/blob/main/Changelog.md). To access source code, head on over to the [**XeroLinuxDev**](https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev) Org.

### What is it?

In short, it's just an alternative to the **XeroLinux Plasma Install** script, making it easier to install **Arch**, bypassing the need for **ArchInstall**. The ISO includes my toolkit as well as my famous **XeroLayan** rice all-in-one shot.

You can use the included **Post-Install Toolkit**, 1st icon with my logo in the Dock, to configure it, keeping in mind that some of the features were already applied to the ISO. I have also taken the liberty of including the [**Chaotic-AUR**](https://aur.chaotic.cx) repository so it's easier for you to install **AUR** packages rather from having to compile them.

### Who ist it for?

It's for all of you out there, who prefer an easier way to install **Arch** and are fans of the **KDE** Desktop Environment, and feel like supporting my work financially while getting something in return. If you prefer not to, or can't, you can always use **ArchInstall** in combination with my **PlasmaInstall** scripts to achieve a similar result.

It will be a bit more complex, but will never cost you anything and the code will forever be made available to fork and modify to your liking.

All I ask for, is for you not to share it with anyone. Otherwise you will be hurting the project making it harder for me to maintain. I am only one man doing all this for you, not a team. Thank you for being supportive.

### Collaboration

While the ISO will always be offered **AS IS**, with no further major features planned, we may introduce some quality-of-life improvements along the way. The goal is to give you total freedom, allowing you to shape the Distro into something uniquely yours.

If you have any ideas on how to enhance the Distro or extend the toolkit's functionality, I'm all ears. After all, a static Distro can become stale over time. However, I’m committed to ensuring it remains versatile and not limited to a single purpose.

Let's collaborate and take this project to new heights while keeping it simple and user-friendly. Your input can make a big difference!

### Wrapping up

This project depends on you. The more support I get, the longer it will live for. I cannot, due to my situation, keep maintaining something like this for free, it costs money. Hosting, Internet, and so on. I hope you understand.

We highly recommend the use of **Ventoy** to boot, so you have **Grub** as fallback in case **SystemD-Boot** fails. If you burn using **Etcher** or similar tools there will be nothing to fall back to. Just an FYI.

With that, I sure hope you enjoy it, and let me know how it goes. For support feel free to join my personal and free [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/5sqxTSuKZu). I will do my best to help.

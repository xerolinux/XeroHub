I love technology. I am a *Multi-OS* User, as in, I don\u2019t stick to one Platform, I like to dabble in all of them. I currently use **iOS** and **Android** when it comes to *Smartphones*. **macOS**, **Windows** and **Linux** when it comes to *Desktop Operating Systems*.\n\n{{< alert icon=\"fire\" cardColor=\"#993350\" iconColor=\"#1d3557\" textColor=\"#f1faee\" >}}\n**Personal Site :** To know more about me, my likes/dislikes, and other juicy details, visit my [**Personal Site**](https://techxero.com).\n{{< /alert >}}\n\nI have been using **Gnu/Linux** since 2019. In 2020 I decided to create **XeroLinux** to satisfy my needs. After sharing it with some friends, they convinced me to make it public, and the rest is history as they say...\n\n### Point of this site\n\nThis site sheds light on some of the most useful **FOSS** tools and guides alongside our various projects as we work on them. It's your one-stop shop for those kinds of posts.\n\n{{< article link=\"/updates/help-needed/\" >}}\n\nAs mentioned on a dedicated post, we will not be posting any Distro reviews or Vs. articles to avoid any drama. Also we try to avoid opinionated posts as much as we can.\n\nEnjoy your stay here.\n\nCheers y'all \ud83d\ude00\n",

      "original_content": "---\ntitle: Our Gear\ndate: 2024-07-12\ndescription: \"The Gear I use\"\n---\n### Information\n\nSome people call me an **Arch** & **KDE Plasma** shill, and I don't see the problem with that. I use what works for me, and **Arch** has been great. Sure, there are issues, but none have been deal-breakers for my use case. I've tried other distros, but **Arch** is the one I can easily adapt to and fix when problems arise. \n\nJust wanted to cover these facts before moving on with the Hardware & Software I use...\n\n### The Hardware\n\nI do own many, 3 Desktops, 2 Laptops and a Mini PC. Main, NAS, Home-Lab & HTPC. Laptops are unimportant just runs my shop and testing various Distros.\n\n**The Beast :**\n\nMain rig, the one I do all my *Development*, *Gaming* and other things on, which I label as **StationXero**.\n\n![SationXero](https://i.imgur.com/2C387dA.png)\n\nIt was recently upgraded to an `RX 7800XT` and a `Ryzen 9 5950X`. I now use **KDE Wayland** on the daily. I am enjoying it so much better now.\n\n**Home-Lab/Proxmox Server :**\n\nThis Mini PC I call **XeroLab**, as the name implies, is my **Home-Lab** PC, it runs all my **Docker Containers** as well as my **Proxmox** server. It has `32GB RAM` after upgrade, with a `Ryzen 5 7530U`.\n\n![XeroLab](https://i.imgur.com/kmw2Heg.png)\n\nThat thing is not showing any signs of slowing down. It's a great little machine. If you want to get one for yourself you can find it here on their [**Official Site**](https://genmachine.tech/products/ren7000-7530u?variant=45301439693085)\n\n**NAS/Storage :**\n\nAnother desktop I call **XeroNAS**, as the name implies, is my **NAS** PC, it stores all my personal data as well as my Linux ISOs & GOG game installers. It has `8GB RAM` with a `Ryzen 5 3600X` and an old `GTX 650 Ti Boost-OC` GPU.\n\n![OMV](https://i.imgur.com/Gwidybq.jpeg)\n\nThat thing is running [**OpenMediaVault**](https://www.openmediavault.org) for managing all the storage. I personally love it for its simplicity and ease of use. It ain't much but it works.\n\n**The HTPC :**\n\nFinally there's my HTPC, which has `Core-i7 6800K`, with a `GTX 1080` GPU, and `32GB RAM`. Now with it being my HTPC, it has 14 Drives of various sizes totalling `~68TB` of storage.\n\n![HTPC](https://i.imgur.com/8K3f8rD.png)\n\nThe only app installed on that thing is [**Plex Server**](https://plex.tv) as a *Snap*.\n\n**Laptop :**\n\nIt is my **Lenovo Thinkpad T14 Gen 1** that I use in the office, with `1Tb nVme`, a `Ryzen 5 PRO 4650U`, `16Gb RAM` and an iGPU.\n\n![ThinkPad](https://i.imgur.com/iTXrFRw.png)\n\nI mainly use this thing for testing other Distros and configs. It never stays on the same OS longer than a month or two. I love it, everything I throw at it works without any issues. It will never see **Windows** mark my words. It's the most **Linux** friendly laptop on the market today... \n\n### Other systems\n\nNow I do have a few other systems that I don't use much if at all, just sitting here collecting dust as decorative pieces. An old **MacBook Pro** from 2016, yeah the one with the faulty butterfly keyboard n thouchbar. I barely use that thing relegated to a shelf somewhere.\n\n![BatoDeck](https://i.imgur.com/3DBBhza.png)\n\nFinally I have the awesome **SteamDeck**, yep I managed to snag one. It's now my *Retro Gaming Console* with [**Batocera**](https://xerolinux.xyz/posts/retro-deck/)  running the show. I absolutely love it ! Sadly I no longer have the time to use it, so it's now sitting behind my monitors teasing me lol ;)\n\n### Thanks for reading\n\nThat's it folks. Now you have a better idea of what equipment I use on a daily basis to bring you everything I do. I did not list all the softwares I use coz it's a long list that varies a lot. Thanks for reading.\n",

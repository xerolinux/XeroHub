### Information

Some of you out there keep calling me an **Arch** & **KDE Plasma** shill. To which I would like to reespond with, what's wrong with that ? I mean, why do you find it so strange for one to use what one likes if it works for them and stick with it ? I like what I like, never had any strange and deal breaking issues that affected my day to day.

That's not to say that issues do not exist, oh they do. But, in my case, for my specific usage, none of them were severe enough to cause me to move away. Annoying, yes, but not deal breaking. I did try many other DEs, like **Gnome**, **XFCE**, **Cinnamon**, even **Hyprland**, none of which worked for me. I found myself having to force myself to adapt to them, while with **KDE Plasma** not so much, it reflects my personality.

I also tried many other Distros, like **Fedora** and many of its spins, **Debian Sid**, **OpenSuse**, **uBlue Aurora**, all with **Plasma**, none of which I could adapt to. **Arch** just works for me, it's super easy to fix when issues do happen.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I am not much of a gamer, so there's that too. If I do play games I have never experienced `120fps` or higher, am used `60fps`, so am fine with that. My current hardware cannot do any better anyway...

Just wanted to cover these facts before moving on with the Hardware & Software I use...

### The Software

- **Linux Distro :**

I love working with **ArchLinux** in all its forms. It's the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Allowing me to build things from the ground up without it being too complex, or getting in my way. That's why all my systems run it or one of its spins.

To summarize, I use **Vanilla Arch** on main rig, **XeroLinux** on HomeLab and **Manjaro** on HTPC. As you can see Arch is at the core of every OS I use.

- **Desktop Environment :**

As for the Desktop Environment I love working with, it's none other than **KDE Plasma**, simply because it's so damn beautiful, and easy to work with. And since I am more of a visual old geezer, it fits my needs so well it ain't a joke. That's why I don't see myself using anything else for a long time to come.

**Note :**

> I do dabble with other Non-Arch Distros and other DEs from time to time to keep my knowledge fresh, and to post about them on this here site.

### The Hardware

I do own many, 3 Desktops, 2 Laptops and a Mini PC. Main, NAS, Home-Lab & HTPC. Laptops are unimportant just runs my shop and testing various Distros.

**The Beast :**

Main rig, the one I do all my *Development*, *Gaming* and other things on, which I label as **StationXero**.

I know the `GTX 1080` is an aging GPU, trust me I am trying to raise money to replace it with at least an `RTX 3080/3090`. I could use better **Wayland** support. Am not really a gamer though, so that part I do not perticularly care about.

**Home-Lab/Proxmox Server :**

This Mini PC I call **XeroLab**, as the name implies, is my **Home-Lab** PC, it runs all my **Docker Containers** as well as my **Proxmox** server. It has `16GB RAM` with a `Zen 5 7530U`.

That thing is not showing any signs of slowing down. It's a great little machine. If you want to get one for yourself you can find it here on their [**Official Site**](https://genmachine.tech/products/ren7000-7530u?variant=45301439693085)


**NAS/Storage :**

Another desktop I call **XeroNAS**, as the name implies, is my **NAS** PC, it stores all my personal data as well as my Linux ISOs & GOG game installers. It has `32GB RAM` with a `Core i7 6800K` and an old P.O.S `GT-710` GPU that I will be replacing as soon as I can raise the money for one.

That thing has survived many failed `nvidia-470xx` driver updates, but I finally decided with how old GPU is to stick with `nouveau` open source drivers.

**The HTPC :**

Finally there's my HTPC, which has the same CPU as **XeroLab**, with a few differences, being the GPU which is a `GTX 650 Ti-Boost OC`, and the `16GB RAM`. Now whith it being my HTPC, it has 14 Drives of various sizes totalling `~68TB` of storage.

The only app installed on that thing is [**Plex Server**](https://plex.tv) as a *Snap*.

Since I need **Hardware Acceleration** so I am able to encode & decode the movies & TV-Shows I watch, I have no choice but to use the Distro provided **nVidia-470xx** proprietary ones. So far so good, no issues.

That's it folks. Now you have a better idea of what equipment I use on a daily basis to bring you everything I do. I did not list all the softwares I use coz it's a long list that varies a lot. Thanks for reading.

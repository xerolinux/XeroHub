Trying on others will result in failure. However it will be opened up in the future so you can install n use it on the likes of Debian and Fedora based distros. Source code =\u0026gt; Here What is it Our fingerprint tool is a handy utility created by us in Rust, that allows you to use your fingerprint reader to authenticate yourself quickly and securely. With this tool, you can enroll your fingerprint through a simple and intuitive GUI, which creates a digital fingerprint profile stored safely on your system.\nOnce set up, it integrates with Linux\u0026rsquo;s authentication framework (such as PAM), letting you log in, or authorize commands like sudo just by placing your finger on the scanner, no need to type your password every time. Setup usually involves installing a package like \u0026ldquo;fprintd,\u0026rdquo; enrolling your fingerprint via command line, and enabling fingerprint authentication for your login and sudo prompts. This improves both the convenience and security of your Linux experience by using biometrics in place of or alongside passwords.\nWe have also taken the time to ensure you do not do anything stupid like locking yourself out of your system. There are checks in place.\nReasons The reason we decided to create this tool is simple, I have a Thinkpad laptop with a fingerprint sensor that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to go to waste, looked for an existing tool that would help with it, but alas I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find one, not on the Arch repos or the A.U.R. There was one, but it\u0026rsquo;s from almost a decade ago, making it incompatible with any of the modern scanners.\nShould I accept it and move on like so many have done in the past ? Nope, I took this as a challenge. So I sat down, and began work on the GUI. And before you ask, yes I used ChatGPT Claude A.I to do it. Remember I am not a developer but an ideas person. Anyway with the GUI in place I went looking for an actual developer who can help bring this idea to life. I have since found one and the rest is history\u0026hellip;\nUsage Support : This tool uses fprintd on the backend. It\u0026rsquo;s just a GUI wrapper for it. So sensor support might limited. There\u0026rsquo;s no definitive list of what devices it does or doesn\u0026rsquo;t support. So all you can do is try and see, then report your findings to the fprintd devs. This tool has an intuitive UI, making it easy to understand and use. It has all the checks in place in order to keep it from locking you out of your system. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to use it.\nAs you can see from the image above, this is the main screen, click on the Enroll Fingerprint button to begin. Note the toggles, they will not be functional until at least one print is registered. Once you have clicked the button, you will be taken to the prints registration page as seen below.\nThere, you select which print you want to register. You got all 5 fingers for each hand. Select the one you want to register an you will be taken to the registration page where you can either delete existing print or add new one. To register click the add button and swipe finger as many times as needed until you see the success message like so\u0026hellip;\nOnce registered, you can go back to register more or back to main screen, where you can enable biometric authentication on either, Login(i), Terminal/Sudo or Polkit/Prompt. No more having to type your password over and over and over again. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing and we had fun working on it.\n(i) : When it comes to Login, the SDDM Display Manager/Greeter currently doesn’t natively support fingerprint login, as a result it won\u0026rsquo;t display a “scan your finger” message. Click the \u0026ldquo;BULB\u0026rdquo; icon to know more. It\u0026rsquo;s a \u0026ldquo;Hack\u0026rdquo; until support is added to SDDM, (if ever lol).\nCredits This tool wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been possible if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for my good friend and now XeroLinux team member Synse. He worked tirelessly to bring life to my idea. Please give him a follow on Github to show support.\nWe will be working on new tools as time passes. Keep an eye out !\nCheers !\n","date":"6 October 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/xero-fingerprint/","section":"","summary":" Status : Before you get all excited, this tool was created for XeroLinux no other distro.

Many of you have become true friends outside the Linux realm, and I deeply appreciate every one of you.\nOur Discord server, while less active than some others, is wonderful just the way it is. It’s a perfect space, free from drama, hate, and, most importantly, judgment. That’s exactly how it should be. As for our community as a whole, I am continually impressed by how calm and mature it is, truly one of the best out there. I am genuinely surprised and grateful. Thank you all.\nThe Changes XeroLinux is currently in the process of shedding some extra weight, but don’t worry, the project as a whole isn’t going anywhere. In fact, things will be changing for the better, I assure you. While we will be losing a few scripts, they will be replaced with new and improved ones that enhance the overall experience.\nAdditionally, we will be discontinuing the Gnome ISO (will continue to function just no more ISOs) and dropping support for other distros to streamline our efforts. I am doing this so I can focus more on the most important aspect—stability—without spreading myself too thin. This project is not about quantity but quality, hence why there will be no more spins, not now not ever, so please do not request any. This refocusing will ensure it continues to thrive as the distro I have always wanted.\nThat’s why, from this point forward, there will only be one version: the KDE version. It’s simply because KDE is the desktop environment I love, flaws and all. It’s a bit like a marriage, committed for the long haul, “til death do us part.” Alongside this change, the Discord server will undergo some minor adjustments as well.\nPlease don’t be shocked if you notice channels being moved or deleted; these changes are meant to keep things organized and focused as we continue to grow and improve. Your understanding and support mean a lot during this transition.\nThe future As for what the future holds, it is a story yet to be written, unfolding step by step as we move forward together. With every challenge we face and every milestone we reach, we shape a path filled with growth and opportunities. I truly believe that things will only get better from here, thanks to the support and encouragement of all of you who have been a part of this journey.\nYour trust and dedication inspire us every day, and together, there’s no limit to what we can achieve.\n","date":"29 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/updates/xerolinux-changes/","section":"","summary":"Thank you I want to sincerely thank each and every one of you here and beyond for all the support you’ve shown.

Keep reading\u0026hellip;\nHow \u0026amp; Why Lately, I’ve been getting a bunch of requests to offer a free version so people can test drive the distro — kind of like a try before you buy. That got me thinking: how do I do that without folks just grabbing the free version and ignoring the paid one?\nInitially, I wrote this guide on how to do it. But more feedback came in, with people saying stuff like “Why should we do all the hard work ourselves?”\nSo, what next? Last night, during the DistroTube Patron Cast, someone suggested something brilliant: why not make a Demo ISO without the installer? Lightbulb moment! I couldn’t believe I hadn’t thought of it before. So I jumped right in and made it happen.\nThe demo ISO won’t include the installer or the toolkit, which means you can’t install the OS from them. Plus, I’ve limited the cow-space to 100MiB — so you won’t be able to update or install big packages. They’re just for testing, so don’t try updating, it won’t work because of the space limit.\nThese demo ISO is now available for download on the main page. Enjoy !\nConclusion We’re really excited to offer this Free Demo ISO as a way for everyone to try out XeroLinux without any risk. It’s all about giving you a hands-on experience so you can see what the distro is all about before deciding to support the project by getting the full, unlocked versions.\nWe hope this approach strikes the perfect balance between sharing our work and encouraging contributions.

X11 (or X.Org) has served the Linux community well for decades, but it’s showing its age and is no longer actively maintained. By embracing Wayland, we’re ensuring XeroLinux remains at the forefront of innovation and stability.\nWe’re also aware of the recent XLibre fork. While we respect the passion behind such projects, we prefer to focus our energy on building a positive, forward-thinking community, free from unnecessary drama.\nGet X11 Back Although XeroLinux no longer includes X11 support by default, especially on our KDE flagship, you still have the flexibility to bring it back if needed. If you require X11 for compatibility reasons or personal preference, simply run the following command to reinstall it :\nsudo pacman -S kwin-x11 plasma-x11-session This ensures you can continue using XeroLinux your way, even as we move forward with Wayland as the default.\nWrap-Up Rest assured, even though X11 is no longer included by default in XeroLinux, our commitment to supporting all users remains unwavering. We will continue to offer assistance and guidance to anyone who needs help with X11 setups or troubleshooting.\nOur goal is to provide a smooth, enjoyable experience for everyone, whether you’re embracing the future with Wayland or relying on X11 for your workflow.

I’ve been paying attention to the Linux community lately and noticed something interesting, there aren’t many reviews or overviews of XeroLinux floating around. I’m guessing it might be because the ISOs are behind a donation wall, which could make it a bit harder for folks to access and try it out.\nHonestly, I’m not entirely sure why, but that’s exactly why I wanted to take a moment to write this post and clear things up. If you’re curious about XeroLinux, or if you’re someone who enjoys sharing your thoughts and experiences with your audience, I’d love for you to consider giving it a try and maybe posting a review on your channel.\nHow to Reach Out Getting your hands on the ISOs is easier than you might think. If you already have an account on Fosstodon, just send me a message there. If you don’t, no worries, you can quickly create an account using this invite link. Alternatively, you can reach out on Discord. No access to those platforms ? Ok how about a simple E-mail.\nJust drop me a link to your channel or platform where you’d like to share your review, and I’ll send you a private download link for one or both ISOs, free of charge of course.\nTo be clear, I’m not asking you to give a glowing review or say anything you don’t truly believe. Honest, genuine feedback is what matters most to me and the community.\nIf you want, we can even have a quick chat before you start so I can walk you through some of the key features and unique aspects of XeroLinux. That way, you’ll have a solid understanding to help shape your content. But really, there’s no pressure, just an open invitation.\nWhy I’m Asking Here’s the honest truth: without reviews and visibility, fewer people learn about XeroLinux, which means less support and fewer donations. Right now, donations are the primary way I keep the project alive and growing. So when you share a review or overview, you’re not just helping me, you’re helping the entire community by bringing more eyes and interest to the project.\nIt’s a win-win! You get to keep the ISOs for free, explore a cool Linux distro, and help a grassroots project gain momentum without spending a dime.\nClosing Words Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and consider helping out. Whether you’re a seasoned reviewer, a Linux enthusiast, or just someone curious about new distros, your voice matters. Every review, big or small, helps build awareness and encourages others to give XeroLinux a try.\nI’m really excited to connect with more people who share a passion for open source and innovation. Feel free to reach out anytime, I’m here to support you and answer any questions you might have. Together, we can make XeroLinux something truly special. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!\nCheers :heart:\n","date":"24 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/updates/xero-reviews/","section":"","summary":"Intro Hey everyone!

We are just a small project trying to be as neutral as possible. Thank you ;) Current Glitch So, Mozilla, in their infinite wisdom, decided to drop a new Terms of Use (TOU) for Firefox back in February 2025. They said it was to be more transparent, but it ended up being about as clear as mud, causing a full-blown user revolt. The original wording made it sound like Mozilla wanted a \u0026ldquo;nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license\u0026rdquo; to all your precious data. Naturally, this raised eyebrows faster than you can say \u0026ldquo;privacy breach,\u0026rdquo; and comparisons to other data-hungry giants were inevitable. Check out this video that pretty much sums it up:\nMozilla, realizing they\u0026rsquo;d stepped in it, quickly backtracked and clarified that they just needed the necessary rights to make Firefox work, not to claim your data as their own. They updated the language to emphasize the limited scope, but the initial kerfuffle had already left a mark.\nA Fork in the Road Here at the XeroLinux HQ, we thought, \u0026ldquo;Hey, let\u0026rsquo;s let the users decide!\u0026rdquo; So, we ran a poll, and the winner was LibreWolf, a browser known for its privacy focus. Seemed like a solid choice, right?\nWrong! This decision detonated a digital war between LibreWolf\u0026rsquo;s supporters and those with concerns about its developer and philosophy. It was like watching two factions battle it out in an MMORPG, and we were caught in the crossfire.\nNeutrality Patch Here\u0026rsquo;s the thing: no matter which big name browser we pick, someone\u0026rsquo;s going to have a problem with it. We can\u0026rsquo;t win this game. But not including any browser at all? That\u0026rsquo;s a recipe for a user riot.\nSo, we\u0026rsquo;re hitting the reset button and sticking to \u0026ldquo;placeholder\u0026rdquo; browsers while still offering a wide selection for you to install later. Think of it as choosing a character class in a game – you get a basic one to start, but you can always switch to a more specialized one later.\nFor the Gnome spin, we\u0026rsquo;re going with Epiphany, and for KDE Plasma, it\u0026rsquo;s Falkon. These browsers are native to their respective desktop environments and, more importantly, politically neutral. This keeps us out of the browser wars and aligns with our project\u0026rsquo;s philosophy.\nBottom Line We\u0026rsquo;re hoping this change will finally calm things down for good. These placeholder browsers are just there to get you started. After that, you can grab your favorite from our toolkit No Judgement ! We\u0026rsquo;ll keep adding more over time.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t see your preferred browser on our list, don\u0026rsquo;t panic! Just head over to Flathub, the AUR, or the official Arch Repos and install it from there.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s that simple! We apologize for the drama, but this was necessary to avoid endless arguments and political debates.

Hey there, fellow tech wizards and Linux enthusiasts!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time for a major update (pun intended) on the XeroLinux front. Due to the lack of earth-shattering new features and major upgrades from both KDE \u0026amp; Gnome, we\u0026rsquo;ve decided to switch gears and adopt a quarterly release schedule. That\u0026rsquo;s right; you\u0026rsquo;ll get your hands on bigger and more awesome updates every three months unless something revolutionary comes along (and let\u0026rsquo;s be honest, who doesn\u0026rsquo;t love a good surprise?).\nThe New Plan Stability First: To keep things as smooth as possible, we\u0026rsquo;re putting the brakes on major tweaks for now, while we do more stability testing. However, smaller but super useful changes/tweaks will continue to sneak their way into future releases.\nToolkit Time: We\u0026rsquo;re shifting focus to our toolkit, making it the ultimate sidekick for both Vanilla ArchLinux (regardless of your DE or WM preferences) and XeroLinux fans. This was always the plan: creating something versatile that works beautifully across different setups.\nImportant Note: Our toolkit is designed to play nicely with Vanilla ArchLinux and XeroLinux itself. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re using any derivatives outside these two, things might get a bit complicated due to potential conflicts with existing modifications.\nQuarterly Releases Ahead: Both KDE Plasma and Gnome versions of XeroLinux will follow this new quarterly schedule. You can still expect the same level of quality and stability that has become synonymous with our distro.\nNo Need to Panic Worry not though! As long as you\u0026rsquo;re rocking XeroLinux like a pro, keeping those updates flowing when they arrive, and using our snazzy \u0026ldquo;Apply latest XeroLinux specific changes/updates\u0026rdquo; option, you won\u0026rsquo;t be missing out on much action! This change will take place after March.\nXeroLinux on Ko-Fi ISOs will continue to be available for new users in the mean-time, just make sure first thing you do post-install is update and reboot your PC in order to benefit from latest features. (You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be behid the rest now, do you?)\nA Big Thank You We appreciate your understanding in this shift towards more strategic development.

What if it could actually help you write code, debug it, and even suggest improvements like that one senior dev who always has the right answer (but without the judgmental sighs)? Enter Cursor AI—the code editor that’s so smart, it might just pass the Turing test while you’re still debugging your for loop.\nBuilt on the solid foundation of Visual Studio Code, Cursor AI is here to make coding faster, smarter, and dare I say, fun. Think of it as your new pair-programming buddy—except this one doesn’t hog the keyboard or insist on using Vim keybindings. Let’s dive in and see why Cursor AI is the editor you didn’t know you needed.\nWhy Cursor AI Is Cooler Than Your Bash Aliases 1. AI Code Completion: Tab-Complete on Steroids Remember when tab-completion felt like magic? Cursor AI takes that feeling and cranks it up to 11. Powered by GPT-4 and Claude, this editor predicts your next line of code faster than you can type git commit -m \u0026quot;fix stuff\u0026quot;. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re wrangling Python dictionaries or taming JavaScript promises, Cursor has your back.\nHere’s an example: You start typing a function to fetch API data, and boom—Cursor finishes your thought like a mind-reading wizard:\ndef get_api_data(url, params=None): response = requests.get(url, params=params) response.raise_for_status() return response.json() It’s like having autocomplete on caffeine. No more Googling “how to fetch data in Python” for the hundredth time.\n2. Smart Code Refactoring: Because Your Codebase Deserves Better Let’s face it: we’ve all written code that looks like it was designed by a committee of sleep-deprived interns. Cursor AI steps in to clean up your mess with surgical precision. It can refactor your code faster than you can say “technical debt,” turning ugly loops into sleek list comprehensions and simplifying conditionals that look like they escaped from a C++ textbook.\nBefore:\nresult = [] for item in items: if item.is_valid(): result.append(item.process()) After (thanks to Cursor):\nresult = [item.process() for item in items if item.is_valid()] It’s like running sudo pacman -Syyu on your entire codebase.\n3. Plain Language Commands: Talk Nerdy to Me Ever wished you could just tell your editor what you want instead of wrestling with syntax? With Cursor AI, you can. Just type something like “Write a function to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to n terms,” and watch as Cursor conjures up:\ndef fibonacci(n): sequence = while len(sequence) \u0026lt; n: sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]) return sequence[:n] It’s basically Stack Overflow without the snarky comments.\n4. Debugging Assistance: Your Personal Rubber Duck (But Smarter) Cursor doesn’t just help you write code—it also helps you fix it when things inevitably go sideways. It highlights bugs, suggests fixes, and even explains what went wrong in plain English (or as plain as programming errors can get). It’s like having an always-available senior dev who doesn’t judge you for forgetting to close your parentheses.\nHow to Get Started with Cursor AI Installing Cursor AI is so easy even a junior dev could do it without breaking production (probably). Head over to cursor.com and grab the installer for your OS of choice. For my fellow Linux nerds out there, here’s how you can get up and running:\nchmod a+x cursor-0.40.3x86_64.AppImage ./cursor-0.40.3x86_64.AppImage Or if you are on ArchLinux you can install directly from the A.U.R like so :\nyay/paru -S --noconfirm cursor-extracted Once installed, set up your environment and get ready to unleash the power of AI on your coding tasks.\nNow you can summon Cursor faster than you can type ls.\nThe Future of Coding with Cursor AI Cursor isn’t just about making today’s coding easier—it’s about shaping the future of development itself. With features like multi-file editing and advanced bug detection on the horizon, this tool is evolving faster than the Linux kernel on release day.\nImagine a world where debugging feels less like defusing a bomb and more like solving a Sudoku puzzle with hints enabled. That’s where we’re headed with Cursor AI.\nConclusion: Embrace the Future (and Stop Writing Bad Code) In the grand scheme of things, coding is already hard enough without fighting your tools. Cursor AI flips the script by becoming an extension of your brain—a co-pilot that helps you navigate through the spaghetti code jungle with ease.\nSo why not give it a try? Download Cursor AI today and let it revolutionize how you write code. After all, life’s too short for bad commits, poorly named variables, or unclosed tags.\nRemember: great developers don’t just write code—they write smart code. And now, with Cursor AI by your side, you’ll be coding smarter than ever before.\nHappy hacking! 🚀\n","date":"21 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/cursor-code-editor/","section":"","summary":"\nCursor AI: The Code Editor That Writes Itself (Almost) Ever wished your code editor could do more than just sit there like a glorified notepad?

However, if you use local ones, you must manually intervene. What\u0026rsquo;s going on ? Recently Pacman, Arch\u0026rsquo;s package manager recieved a major upgrade to R7.0, which brought with it a ton of changes, some of which will require manual intervention.\nThe Changes The new major version brings many new features, including introducing support for downloading packages as a separate user with reduced privileges.\nWhile this enhancement improves security, users with local repositories may need to perform manual interventions to ensure seamless operation. Here’s what it’s all about.\nFor those utilizing local repositories, the new download user might not have the necessary access permissions to the repository files. This can prevent packages from downloading correctly.\nTo resolve this issue, you should assign the repository files and folders to the “alpm” group and ensure that the executable bit (“+x“) is set on the directories in question.\nThe group (and the user) are automatically set up during the upgrade to Pacman 7.0, so if you follow the terminal’s output, you will see the following messages:\nCreating group \u0026#39;alpm\u0026#39; with GID 946. Creating user \u0026#39;alpm\u0026#39; (Arch Linux Package Management) with UID 946 and GID 946. Here’s how you can do it:\nsudo chown :alpm -R /path/to/local/repo This command changes the group ownership of your local repository files to alpm group, allowing the Pacman’s download user to access them appropriately.\nAdditionally, you will need to merge any .pacnew files generated during the update. These files contain new default configurations introduced with Pacman 7.0. Merging them ensures you’re using the latest settings and helps prevent potential conflicts.\nNow, I have written a simple command that will do that quickly and efficiantly, while enabling some hidden features if you haven\u0026rsquo;t enabled them yet. This also avoids the need to re-add any additional repos you might have had in there.\nsudo sed -i \u0026#39;/^# Misc options/,/ParallelDownloads = [0-9]*/c\\# Misc options\\nColor\\nILoveCandy\\nCheckSpace\\n#DisableSandbox\\nDownloadUser = alpm\\nDisableDownloadTimeout\\nParallelDownloads = 10\u0026#39; /etc/pacman.conf We are done with pacman.conf. Furthermore, Pacman 7.0 also introduces changes to improve checksum stability for Git repositories that use .gitattributes files.\nConsequently, you might need to update the checksums in your PKGBUILD files that source from Git repositories. This is a one-time adjustment to accommodate the new checksum calculation method.\nAUR Helpers Heads Up : If you use yay to install packages from AUR, be aware that after upgrading to Pacman 7.0, you’ll see an error message when trying to use it. paru/yay: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.14: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory Just in case you use an AUR helper, you will need to either recompile it since libalpm.so was updated to version 15. If you are using the -git version, otherwise if you are using the normal or -bin versions you will need to wait for them to get updated. Or switch to -git (not very recommended), up to you.\nsudo pacman -S paru-git Agree and replace one with the other. Have fun ;)\nMakepkg / Rust A few other changes were introduced with this update, especially if you compile your own packages. One of the affected files is makepkg.conf which contains the flags and packager info. Do this only if you are a package maintainer.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how you can merge the changes :\ndiff -u /etc/makepkg.conf /etc/makepkg.conf.pacnew \u0026gt; diff.patch This creates a file called diff.patch with the differences in a unified format, which is more readable and suitable for merging.\nApply the patch (diff) to the makepkg.conf file using the patch command:\nsudo patch /etc/makepkg.conf \u0026lt; diff.patch Last file to be affected, is rust.conf under /etc/makepkg.conf.d/. To merge changes, follow the same steps mentioned earlier for makepkg.conf replacing the file path and name to the ones of rust.conf.\nWrapping up Pacman doesn\u0026rsquo;t get updated very often and when it does, there will always be some manual intervention of sorts. Also since AUR Helpers kinda rely on it, if you can\u0026rsquo;t wait for maintainers to update stable version, install -git one, not always the best recourse as those can break at any moment. Instead, I would highly recommend, if you really want to install packages from the AUR, to do it without the use of a helper, like so:\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/packagename.git cd packagename/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; makepkg -si Also if you are using any GUI Packages Managers you will also need to either recompile them or wait for them to get updated. It\u0026rsquo;s the nature of Rolling release Distros.\nIf you want to learn more about how to use Pacman and become a pro, I would highly recommend This Awesome Guide by @Linuxiac.\nI hope this helps y\u0026rsquo;all\u0026hellip;\n","date":"15 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/pacman-update/","section":"","summary":"\nNotice : Attention Arch users, Pacman 7.0 has just landed in stable Arch’s repos.

Still knowing how to build a fresh one can be useful in a bind, am I right ?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s do this First off we need to grab a few packages in order to be able to build the ISO. Keep in mind that in order to do this you must be on Arch. In case you aren\u0026rsquo;t, that\u0026rsquo;s where Distrobox comes in really handy.\nsudo pacman -S archiso Now we need create two folders in our home directory or anywhere else, up to you, one called ArchWork for placing extracted files, another called ArchOut where final ISO will be located.\nmkdir ~/ArchWork \u0026amp;\u0026amp; mkdir ~/ArchOut Now that it\u0026rsquo;s all done we can proceed to building a fresh new \u0026amp; updated ArchISO.

If you care to give it a whirl, keeping in mind the status of the project, you can grab it from the XeroLinux Wiki. What is Cosmic DE? The Cosmic DE is a new desktop environment being developed by the team behind Pop!_OS, a popular Linux distribution. Unlike their previous efforts, which built upon GNOME, the Cosmic DE is a ground-up development using Rust and a custom compositor built on Smithay, aiming for a lightweight, responsive, and customizable user interface.\nIts most notable feature is, tiling window management with stacking, and a more integrated experience with the Pop!_OS ecosystem, enhancing performance and user control. It aims to offer a modern alternative to existing desktop environments, designed specifically for Linux users\u0026rsquo; needs.\nInstalling Cosmic on Arch Notice : Project is still in Alpha 1 stages, please don\u0026rsquo;t use as a daily driver. It\u0026rsquo;s still missing a ton of features. Install at your own risk ! When it comes to installing Cosmic DE, it has now become as easy as ever thanks to the ArchInstall script included on every Arch ISO starting v2.8.5. Yes, even though it\u0026rsquo;s still in Alpha stages, for whatever reason, it has now made its way to the Extra repo on Arch.\nNow I will not be going through how to use the ArchInstall script here, just watch the included video which covers it all. If you chose this Distro, then you should know how to use it by now lol.\nAs you can see from the video above, all you have to do it grab the latest Arch ISO, boot into it and launch the ArchInstall then go through the motions as usual. I would change up the command a bit like so, making sure we are always running the latest version of the script :\npacman -Syy archinstall \u0026amp;\u0026amp; archinstall --advanced As mentioned in the video the --advanced flag is required to unlock the Cosmic DE desktop profile. The reason it\u0026rsquo;s hidden should be clear enough, in case it\u0026rsquo;s not, well it\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s in Alpha and no one sane enough who requires any kind of stability should install it.\nAlso, note the issue with the Cosmic Greeter, it could be that the maintainer of the packages on Arch forgot to include it or something else. If you are trying it way after this was written, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s been fixed, if not then do as shown below to fix it.\nOnce all packages are installed, Before you exit chroot n reboot use this command :\npacman -Syy cosmic-greeter systemctl enable cosmic-greeter.service Now that this is fixed, I would like to take this oportunity to mention that there\u0026rsquo;s 2 more missing packages that ArchInstall failed to include, those are xdg-user-dirs which is resonsible for creating you user folders, like Dicuments, Pictures, Videos..., and finally the power-profiles-daemon tool that allows you to switch power profiles, so to fix those do this\u0026hellip;\npacman -Syy xdg-user-dirs power-profiles-daemon xdg-user-dirs-update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; systemctl enable power-profiles-daemon.service Done ! All missing essential features fixed. Keep in mind that it\u0026rsquo;s only natural for them to exist, project is still in Alpha stages, a lot of things need to be addressed. Give it time to mature before judging it, and more importantly report all the bugs related to it or any feature requests you might have upstream, to the Cosmic Bug Tracker\nCustomization As we know, Cosmic DE will be highly customizable out of the box. It comes between Gnome and KDE Plasma. Meaning we can modify it more than the former but less than the latter. Still in my opinion that\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\nThere are some caveats however, those being that Qt apps are still not fully supported eg. Kvantum, especially if you are used to the tried and true Global Menu which will not be officially supported as it\u0026rsquo;s way too complex according to the devs. Also the Blur effect not there yet. Maybe in the future someone will port it over ? I dunno about LibAdwaita though, from what I have heard, support coming not yet there.\nSo if you are looking for consistency, it will be a long while before we can achieve it. Still, this did not stop some theme developers from porting their themes over to it. So if you would like to try them out, just head on over to the \u0026raquo; Cosmic-Themes \u0026ldquo;store\u0026rdquo; and grab the one(s) you like. Importing the .ron files is easy just open Settings \u0026gt; Desktop \u0026gt; Desktop \u0026amp; Panel \u0026gt; Import, then select file n see it apply immediately.\nWrapping up As mentioned, I would highly recommend you install Cosmic DE on a spare non-essential device since it\u0026rsquo;s still Alpha 1 software. And you will need modern enough hardware that has full support for Wayland since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t nor will it ever have X11 support.\nHowever, if you are an Arch power user and prefer to do it the manual way, you can. Just head on over to the wonderful ArchWiki and follow the instructions there. I would recommend it over ArchInstall as you can do more and have more flexibility.\nFinally if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use it on Arch, you can grab their Official Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS alpha ISO from \u0026raquo; Cosmic Downloads. They also have instructions for other Distros like Fedora, NixOS and more\u0026hellip;\nIf you want to know what I think of this DE, and read how my experience with it went, check this post on \u0026raquo; DarkXero\u0026rsquo;s Bytes\nI hope this post has proven to be useful.\nCheers !\n","date":"4 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/arch-cosmic/","section":"","summary":"\nCosmic Script : I have gone ahead and written a script that will help you do all this and more in one swoop.

Don\u0026rsquo;t you wish there were shorter and easier ones ? Well, you are in luck. This post will cover how you can create your own easy to remember Aliases.\nWhat are aliases? Basically, they are custom user created commands, by you, that execute various actions. However, I would highly recommend you check if you have any tools installed that have similar ones, and avoid replicating or replacing them.\nHow to create Aliases First, before you start, you will have to know what shell you are using, as different ones use different config files. In case of Bash you will have to edit the .bashrc file found in your home directory\u0026rsquo;s root. And in the case of ZSH, it will be the .zshrc file found at that same location and so on.\nWith that out of the way, the method is the same for both. Just open relevant file in your IDE of choice and let\u0026rsquo;s begin.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how aliases are structured :\nalias shortcmd=\u0026#34;actualcmd\u0026#34; Update System (Arch) : alias up=\u0026#34;sudo pacman -Syu\u0026#34; Install Package : alias in=\u0026#34;sudo pacman -S --needed \u0026#34; Search for Package : alias search=\u0026#34;pacman -Ss \u0026#34; You can also use aliases to execute scripts and edit files among many many many other things. They are amazing. I use a ton of them in XeroLinux. To check them out visit this link \u0026raquo; XeroLinux Aliases.\nQuick examples :\nEdit Pacman.conf alias npcm=\u0026#34;sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf\u0026#34; Execute script : alias cmd=\u0026#34;/path/to/script/sript.sh\u0026#34; You get the idea. Now save your file, restart your terminal and test them out. The sky\u0026rsquo;s the limit as how many you can create.\nWrapping up Using aliases makes one\u0026rsquo;s Linux journey a much more pleasant one. So do not hesitate to use them. I, like everyone else get frustrated with having to memorize the ones provided by the distro am using. Especially why I test so many. That\u0026rsquo;s the first thing I do when installing a distro.

Want to get rid of the 60FPS frame cap? Well, do we have the tool for you. Read on my dear adventurer\u0026hellip;\nWhat is this? ER-Patcher is a sophisticated tool crafted to significantly enhance your Elden Ring gameplay on Linux through Proton and natively on Windows. It offers a suite of features tailored to improve both performance and visual experience.\nWhat does it do? Think of it as your in-game cheat code, but for real-life gaming bliss. Here\u0026rsquo;s an in-depth look at what it brings to the table:\nCustom Frame Rate Limits: Fine-tune the game\u0026rsquo;s frame rate to achieve the smoothest gameplay possible, ensuring an optimal balance between performance and visual quality. Ultrawide Monitor Support: Fully utilize your ultrawide monitor, eliminating those pesky black bars and immersing you deeper into the game’s stunning landscapes. Protect Your Runes: Disable rune loss upon death, providing a more forgiving gameplay experience and allowing you to focus on your adventure without the fear of losing progress. Skip Intro Logos: Get straight to the action by bypassing the introductory logos, saving time and keeping you engaged in the game. Enhanced Visual Clarity: Remove visual effects like vignette and chromatic aberration for a cleaner, sharper image, making every detail of the game world more vivid and enjoyable. How it works When you launch the game through Steam, ER-Patcher creates a temporary patched version of eldenring.exe, leaving the original file untouched. If the --with-eac flag is not set, the tool modifies the Steam launch command to use the patched executable instead of start_protected_game.exe. This ensures the patched version never runs with Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) enabled. After you close the game, the patched executable is automatically removed, maintaining the integrity of the original game files.\nHow to use ER-Patcher The Patcher is super easy to use. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to worry about here. But before moving on, please read the warning below, it\u0026rsquo;s very important that you do.\nUse at your own risk! This tool is based on patching the game executable through hex-edits. However it is done in a safe and non-destructive way, that ensures the patched executable is never run with EAC enabled (unless explicity told to do so). Installation: Place the er-patcher tool in your Elden Ring game directory. Configuration: Set the Steam launch options to integrate the patcher seamlessly with the game using the command: python er-patcher ARGS -- %command% Launch Game: Start the game via Steam, and enjoy the enhanced features immediately. ER-Patcher transforms your Elden Ring experience, making it smoother, more visually stunning, and more accessible, whether you are on Linux or Windows. For detailed instructions and additional configuration options, visit the project GitHub page.\ngurrgur/er-patcher Elden Ring enhancement patches (ultrawide support, custom frame rate limits and more) seamlessly integrated with steam. Python 371 26 Wrapping Up To clarify, I do not play these types of games, so, though I did not test this myself, as you saw in the included video, my good friend @A1RM4X did and it seems solid enough.\nBut after watching many of his streams where he was using this tool, I have noticed that it can be flaky at times, especially when game is transitioning from in-game footage to a cut-scene after killing a Boss, causing game to crash.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I would Highly recommend you disable it during a Boss fight, especially a big one, and re-enable it once cut-scene is over and done. That\u0026rsquo;s the only instability I have seen thus far.\nAlso, beware using this in Online-Mode, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend it fearing the Ban-Hammer. So if you do decide to use it while online and get banned, you got only yourself to blame.\nThat’s it folks, have fun with unlocked gaming\u0026hellip;\nCheers !\n","date":"2 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/eldenring-patcher/","section":"","summary":"Do you love Elden Ring and want to unlock its true potential?

BlueBuild is a nifty toolkit for creating custom images of Linux distributions, similar to Bluefin. It simplifies the process by allowing you to tweak configurations in a straightforward recipe.yml file, perfect for those who want to share their personalized setups. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a container wizard or a GitHub guru to get started—basic git and text editor skills will do. Just follow the documentation, ask the friendly community for help, and soon you\u0026rsquo;ll be building custom Linux images like a pro.\nblue-build/workshop WIP Svelte 15 4 All images will be based off of Fedora and have Atomic elements. No Debian or ArchLinux bases as of the writing of this post. Maybe in the future? Also this project is totally unrelated to uBlue or Bluefin.\nWhat’s a custom image? Picture this: a custom image in the Linux world is like a gourmet pizza you can switch to without having to bake from scratch every time. So, making your own distro? Well, it’s kind of like claiming you’ve invented pizza when you’re really just adding your favorite toppings. When you’re whipping up custom images, you’re basically taking a tried-and-true Linux distro and sprinkling on your personal favorite apps and settings.\nThink of it as curating a playlist with your best jams, but for your operating system. You’re still using the distro’s package manager and repositories, just with a dash of your unique flavor. It’s a lot like sharing your meticulously crafted dotfiles, but instead of just the configs, it’s the whole shebang of the OS with your personalized touch.\nBlueBuild and uBlue Differences Universal Blue is an open source project started by cloud developers that builds amazing custom images based on Atomic Fedora along with related experiments, while BlueBuild only builds tools for custom image creation. The project now known as BlueBuild started out as just a part of Universal Blue, but was eventually split from it due to diverging from the scope and being mostly unrelated to the project’s main maintainers.\nWhy use it? To answer this question, I will say, this is not meant for everyone. But if you are a FOSS tinkerer and would like to create your own image(s) with your ideal configs and set of tools that anyone could Rebase to, then this is for you. This thing is so flexible.\nBluefin Aurora 1 July 2024\u0026middot;5 mins\u0026middot; loading \u0026middot; loading Just keep in mind that This isn\u0026rsquo;t a distro builder, just a custom image builder. Remember that. Although you can generate ISOs from it, that\u0026rsquo;s not what project was meant to be used for.\nBenefits vs Drawbacks The Benefits Now I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to put this, but you can do so much with this thing. As to benefits, I can\u0026rsquo;t say much beyond what I already have. With the right amount of Linux knowledge you can take it to another level. You can build images that rival the likes of Bluefin and its derivatives to a certain degree using just images no ISOs to maintain, set it n forget it style. It\u0026rsquo;s all up to you \u0026amp; your level of knowledge.\nThe Drawbacks This project is still young, so it will naturally come with some growing pains. As to drawbacks, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have many if any. The devs are doing a great job with it. The only thing I may not like, is the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s only Fedora based, since am an Arch user myself. But that\u0026rsquo;s not a drawback at all.\nMy thoughts on BlueBuild I have used this project to create my very own image called XeroDora based on the uBlue Kinoite image, and at first glance it looked easy enough to pull off. But after digging deeper, as I always do, it\u0026rsquo;s not all as straightforward as I\u0026rsquo;d hoped. You will hit a few snags, which I find natural with every relatively new FOSS project.\nOne example being, dependencies. I keep running into this problem over and over and over. However it\u0026rsquo;s unrelated to the project, it\u0026rsquo;s just Fedora being Fedora. Still a newcomer will not be able to differentiate.\nOne idea would be to have some sort of error logs for the modules. Like, BlueBuild sees that the command failed and provides some help tips. (Thanks @tulip for suggestion) which would make it easier to debug.\nBottom line is, although devs are doing their best to make the project as easy as possible to use, sometimes issues happen outside project itself that require a lot of Linux know-how to troubleshoot. So as easy as it appears to be, it really isn\u0026rsquo;t as I first thought.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong here, I still love the project though, and so should you if you like stuff like that. That\u0026rsquo;s why I will keep a close eye on it and see where it goes. I have super high hopes for it. As an Arch user, and ex-Distro maintainer, I see many images being born using this down the line\u0026hellip;\nPlease do not judge it too harshly just yet. It still has a long way to go. And devs are on the right track. If you encounter any issues, I would highly recommend you join their Discord server for help.\nThat’s it folks ..\nCheers !\n","date":"1 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/bluebuild-workshop/","section":"","summary":"What is BlueBuild Workshop?

I love ricing my setups. I hated that macOS \u0026amp; Windows did not allow this.\nAnd if you want to see what I have managed to do, well, hop on over to my Layan rice\u0026rsquo;s Githup repository, you will get blown away.\nxerolinux/xero-layan-git XeroLinux Layan Rice QML 166 17 A bit of understanding Ricing can be a bit invloved. At least if you are like me, and care about consistency. It\u0026rsquo;s not about just slapping a desktop theme and calling it a day. That\u0026rsquo;s just lazy. Please don\u0026rsquo;t do that.\nKDE Plasma is a ricing a beast, no doubt about that. That\u0026rsquo;s one of its biggest selling points. So it\u0026rsquo;s normal when I say, it can be very, very intricate. You can rice everything in it.\nWe need to also know what library the system uses. KDE uses a library called Qt, pronounced like cute. But you might encounter apps that use the GTK2/3/4 library, typically ones created for Gnome or XFCE.\nKeep in mind though, to successfully theme GTK4 or, as it\u0026rsquo;s called now LibAdwaita, we need to make sure the necessary Hacks are included in the theme we have chosen, simply because, as we all know, Gnome devs despise the whole idea of theming for whatever reason.\nSo it will be up to you, the user, to find all theme elements required for a complete and consistent look. Whay do I say this you may ask? Well, quite simply because, and it saddens me to say this, very few themes come complete, allowing such consistency. But it can be done.\nWith that out of the way, let\u0026rsquo;s get to it shall we ?\nKDE Plasma pieces As I said earlier in the post, KDE Plasma is made of many elements that can be themed or riced. So here, I will be explaining what they are and the tools we need to theme them.\nFriendly Advice : Never install themes from any repos or the AUR. Always grab them from source, after you have inspected the code. For your own sanity. And make sure they are compatible with Plasma 6. Please read the above warning, ignoring it will result in nothing but headaches. Trust me, I made that mistake and wasted more time than I can count trying to solve the resulting issues.\nKvantum Manager First, we will need and app that I highly recommend to have on hand, called Kvantum. I consider it an essantial tool for every ricer out there.\ntsujan/Kvantum A Linux SVG-based theme engine for Qt and KDE C\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 1862 161 This will take care of the awesome window blur and transparency effects for all Qt based apps. It will not work on anything else, keep that in mind.\nSDDM Login Manager Another element KDE Plasma uses, is SDDM for its Display Manager/Login.\nIt too can be themed.\nGrub Bootloader Now, I can already hear you say that this is unrelated to KDE Plasma, to which I will say, yes I agree. Also, not everyone will be using Grub. Also true.\nBut for the sake of completeness, I do like to theme it as well.\nKonsole Terminal Emulator Konsole is the Terminal Emulator that Plasma ships. I know most of you switch to Alacritty or even Kitty. But I prefer to stick with what ships with the DE I use.\nThat too can be themed.\nThe more complete the better Now that we have an understanding of the various elements that make for a more complete experience, here\u0026rsquo;s what themes we choose need to have before using them.\nNot all of them contain all the elements. Sadly there are some out there that are incomplete making it harder to get a cohesive look. So I would avoid those if I were you.\nOnce we have found a noce theme, we need to make sure it applies to the following parts of Plasma :\nColors : Resposible for accent and window colors. Application Style : Theme specific Kvantum style. Plasma Style : Light/Dark window style. Window Decorations : The top window minimize/close/maximize bar. Cursors : Cursor theme (Optional) Icons : A fitting icon theme. (Optional) SDDM : Login theme. That\u0026rsquo;s it really. In case you do not find a theme that contains all these elements, it\u0026rsquo;s not a huge issue, you can always hunt for one that fits the Global Theme. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to find one I know, but who knows you might get lucky lol.\nApplying our themes Once you have downloaded your chosen theme and theme elements from their sources (Github/Gitlab), follow their respective guides to install them, then head on over to the KDE Settings to apply them.\nFor Kvantum, just launch it, select the theme from the drop down and hit apply. Then select it as the Application Style.\nAs for Konsole, launch it, make sure you have moved its theme file into ~/.local/share/konsole/ folder, right click inside its window, select create new profile from the context menu, give it a name, one that you recognize, on the left click on appearance, select your theme, if you want to enable transparency with blur, click on edit, this is where you do that. Confirm, done.\nNow I will not talk about Grub here since all themes for it will come with their own instructions and/or install scripts.\nPanel \u0026amp; Widgets Oh boy, the reason I will not be talking about those is is simple, it\u0026rsquo;s your rice you do with those as you please. KDE Plasma comes with some awesome widgets, use those to get started, if you want more, well, you will find them on the KDE Store.\nWarning : Please make sure they are compatible with Plasma 6. As for the panel, position it wherever your heart desires. Top, bottom, left or right. It\u0026rsquo;s all up to you. You can even use it as a Dock. Above is the end result of my very own rice I call the XeroLayan rice.\nBonus for the G33ks As a bonus, for all the G33ks out there, I would like to include a nice find. Some of us would love to make our rices reproduce-able without having to apply every element over and over, others just want to have a backup.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where this Github Repo comes in handy. It shows us what files are affected by the various theme elements. So have at it and enjoy !\nshalva97/kde-configuration-files KDE plasma configuration files Shell 1004 62 Don\u0026rsquo;t forget about Konsave the GUI tool that does exactly that, just in a much simpler way. Article attached below.\nKonsave TUI 27 June 2024\u0026middot;2 mins\u0026middot; loading \u0026middot; loading That\u0026rsquo;s all se wrote folks.

Are you like me, and prefer to replace SteamOS with Batocera transforming your Deck into a Retro Gaming powerhouse ? Then this guide is for you\u0026hellip;\nBatocera Batocera is an open-source and completely free retro-gaming distribution that can be copied to a USB stick or an SD card with the aim of turning any computer/nano computer into a gaming console during a game or permanently. Batocera.linux does not require any modification on your computer. Note that you must own the games you play in order to comply with the law.\nbatocera-linux/batocera.linux batocera.linux Python 2833 661 A few notes before we begin In case you disagree with the idea behind this guide, and prefer to Dual-Boot SteamOS with Batocera for whatever reason, fear not I have written a guide covering just that. Find it below.\nBatocera On Deck - Part 1 15 July 2024\u0026middot;7 mins\u0026middot; loading \u0026middot; loading Also this guide requires a bit of Linux knowledge. Since that method is considered less than ideal by many. The Deck was not made to be used that way so to speak. It\u0026rsquo;s more of a hack than an official thing.\nUser Caution. Tackle this Only if you know what you are doing, do it AT YOUR OWN RISK. This is a destructive guide, which will wipe any traces of SteamOS\u0026hellip; The reason why I for one never cared about playing Triple-A games on that thing. Maybe indie games yes, reason being, I never saw any advantage of going from high FPS to extremely low just to justify my purchase. In my eyes the Deck has always been a monster Emulation Machine, no more no less. That\u0026rsquo;s where am gonna leave it. Say what you will, it\u0026rsquo;s my Deck, so I can do with it as I please. Freedom\u0026hellip;\nNow on with the guide eh ?\nWhat You Need: Below is a list of things you will need before we proceed. I would recommend 2 cards, one you will be using and another as a backup, just in case something goes wrong.\nLinux Mint Debian Edition ISO. MicroSD Card: A fast U3 A2 card for ROM storage. Batocera Image: The image we will be using. Balena Etcher: Tool for flashing the image onto the microSD card Steam Deck: Your ultimate gaming device. Deck Dock for easy navigation via Keyboard \u0026amp; mouse. Step-by-Step Guide 1. Download LMDE:\nFirst things first, head over to the Linix Mint and grab the latest Linux Mint Debian Edition ISO. This is the Distro we will be using temporarily in order to Flash Batocera on Deck\u0026rsquo;s internal storage. It\u0026rsquo;s the only one I had on hand that actually worked, surprising isn\u0026rsquo;t it ?\nBooting LMDE\nPut it on your Ventoy USB, or flash it on USB stick with Balena Etcher choice is yours. Once done, power down the Deck, plug the stick in and boot it while holding the Volume up + Power, release power keep holding volume up until you are on the bios screen. Then select Boot Manager then choose to boot from the stick you created. This will boot into LMDE and get you on the desktop.\nConnecting to WiFi\nI would recommend you be connected over ethernet via Dongle/Hub if you can, but if you can\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s Ok, I will show you how to connect to WiFi.\nUsing your mouse n keyboard, click on the WiFi icon in the system tray, select your connection and enter you password. That\u0026rsquo;s it. If you do not have a dongle or hub then it will be more difficult since LMDE was not created with the Deck in mind.\nYou would have to go into Settings \u0026gt; Accessibility \u0026gt; Keyboard and enable it from there. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you really. That\u0026rsquo;s why I would highly recommend you have a Hub/Dongle/Dock handy.\n2. Download Batocera:\nNow, head over to the Batocera Site and grab the latest image for the Steam Deck. Make sure you select the correct image for your Steam Deck’s architecture – this is crucial to avoid any hiccups later on.\n3. Install Balena Etcher:\nNext up, we need Balena Etcher. This handy tool will flash the Batocera image onto your microSD card. Download it from Balena\u0026rsquo;s Site, install it on your Steam Deck, and fire it up. It’s super user-friendly, so no need to sweat this part.\n4. Flash Batocera to Internal Storage:\nOpen Balena Etcher, select the Batocera image file you just downloaded, and select the Deck\u0026rsquo;s SSD as the target. Hit the “Flash!” button and watch the magic happen. This process This should be done quick since image is only 3GB in size and you are flashing to a speedy SSD.\n5. Booting into Batocera:\nOnce the flashing is done, power down the Deck and remove the USB. Now, power on the Deck and voila! You’re booting into Batocera. Welcome to the retro world!\n6. First Time Setup:\nWhen you boot into Batocera for the first time, there are a few housekeeping items to handle:\nConnect to WiFi: Press the Start button, navigate to Network Settings, and enable WiFi. Select your network and enter the password. You’re online and ready to go! Configure Controllers: Most controllers are supported right out of the box. Connect via USB or Bluetooth, then head to Controller Settings to map buttons if needed. Easy peasy. System Language: If you prefer a language other than English, go to System Settings and change the language. Now you can navigate in your language of choice. 7. Adding Your Games:\nThis is where the fun begins. You need to add your game ROMs/Bios Files:\nFor security reasons, and to avoid this post from being flagged, I will not be showing where to get any of them from. That\u0026rsquo;s up to you.\nConnect your Steam Deck to a PC or use the built-in file manager. Transfer your game ROMs to the “share/roms” directory on the Deck. Transfer your Bios files too for any 3D/Disc based consoles. Although you can put your ROMs on the Deck\u0026rsquo;s internal SSD, do that only if you have either have enough storage (1tb or more) or as I said earlier, in case you don\u0026rsquo;t, then in Batocera\u0026rsquo;s menu, set the game storage to external and select microSD card (1tb recommended). Especially if you are like me and currently own complete ROM Sets, which can get HUGE ! I mean my PS1 RomSet alone is 600GB.. LoL.\nIf you want to do it over WiFi, just use your Distro\u0026rsquo;s file manager, in the address bar head on over to the device\u0026rsquo;s IP adderess that you can get from Network Settings.\nLike so, smb://ipaddress. Keep in mind you will need a functional installation of SAMBA for your distro. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how, I guess it\u0026rsquo;s time to use the power of Google lol.\nIn short, would be easier to have ROMs on a microSD card than internal storage, simply because you can just plug it into your PC/Laptop n do the transfer that way. Over WiFI would be slow and unreliable. Same with ethernet.\n8. Customizing Batocera:\nNow, let’s make Batocera your own:\nThemes: Go to the UI Settings to change themes and give Batocera a fresh look. There are plenty to choose from, so find one that screams “you.” Shaders: Enhance your gaming experience with graphical shaders. Find them in the Video Settings. They can make your games look even better than you remember. Emulator Settings: Tweak individual emulator settings for optimal performance. This can make a huge difference in how smoothly your games run. Wrapping It Up Before Batocera, my Steam Deck felt like a reliable but joyless workhorse. Installing Batocera changed everything. It transformed my Deck into a retro gaming paradise, making it feel more like the fun, nostalgic handhelds I love. With the retro magic of Batocera, my appreciation for the Deck skyrocketed.\nIn short, Batocera brings the joy of retro gaming front and center, making everything feel delightfully vintage and new all at once.\nEnjoy your retro gaming adventure on the Steam Deck! With this guide, you\u0026rsquo;re all set to dive into the golden age of gaming.

Recently @DistroTube made a video about an extension that most of you out there might like, so I thought, why not post about it here\u0026hellip;\nTiling Shell Information This is a Gnome Shell extension implementing modern windows tiling system by extending GNOME\u0026rsquo;s default 2 columns to any layout you want! Can be installed on Gnome Shells from 40 to 46 on X11 and Wayland: the most recent GNOME Shell is supported, and older releases will include all the features and bug fixes!\n🤩 First and only extension that provides Windows 11\u0026rsquo;s snap assistant 🖥️🖥️ multiple monitors support, even with different scaling factors! ⚙️ Manage, edit, create and delete layouts with a built-in editor 💡 Layouts are not strict, you can span multiple tiles if you want 🚀 Automatically sets the same UI of your GNOME theme, for a seamless integration! Tiling Shell Installation Before I tell you how to grab it, let me caution you with this\u0026hellip;\nGrab it either from the Gnome Extenstions site or via the Extension Manager app Not the A.U.R or any repos. With that out of the way, I say this coz many have tried grabbing it from the AUR only to suffer maintainers lagging behind on updates. It\u0026rsquo;s better to get it straight from source rather than rely on a 3rd party maintainer (man in the middle).\nIf you are using the XeroLinux toolkit, I added an option that will install everything you need to start customizing your Gnome experience. Which includes the Extension Manager application, that can be found under the 4 : System Customization menu.\nXeroLinuxDev/xlapit-cli Shell 2 0 Now that you got the extension installed, here\u0026rsquo;s some usage tips.\nTiling Shell Usage Tiling System When grabbing and moving a window, press CTRL key to show the tiling layout (you can choose another key from the preferences). When moving on a tile, it will highlight. Ungrab the window to place that window on the highlighted tile.\nThis extension and the tiling system also implements Windows PowerToys FancyZones!\nSnap Assistant When grabbing and moving a window, the snap assistant will be available on top of the screen. Move the window near it to activate the snap assistant. While still grabbing the window, move your mouse to the tile you are interested in. By stopping grabbing the window will be tiled to the selected tile!\nSelect a layout Click on Tiling Shell\u0026rsquo;s panel indicator and the available layouts will be shown. Select the one you prefer by clicking on it. That layout will be applied to every monitor in case you have more than one.\nSelect multiple tiles The layout is not strict. You can select multiple tiles too! Just hold ALT while using the tiling system (you can choose another key from the preferences).\nSplit a tile : LEFT CLICK Split a tile vertically : LEFT CLICK + CTRL Delete a tile : RIGHT CLICK Save, or open the menu : Click the tray icon Smart resize You can resize adjacent tiled windows together!\nIt can be enabled/disabled from the preferences\nTile using Keyboard Move window through the tiles using keyboard shortcuts (SUPER+←/↑/↓/→). They can be customized from the preferences!\nEdge Tiling You can tile a window by moving it to the edge.\nWrapping up That covers the basics. Now I just copy pasted from project Git, where you will find much more info, and can report issues should you encounter any. Here, I linked it below..\ndomferr/tilingshell Extend Gnome Shell with advanced tiling window management. Supports multiple monitors, Windows 11 Snap Assistant, Fancy Zones, customised tiling layouts and more. TypeScript 1622 69 Even though I do not like or use Window Tiling myself, I think the developer behind this extension was heavily inspired by Windows\u0026rsquo; PowerToys Fancy Zones. I do not find this wrong in the slightest, on the contrary, it\u0026rsquo;s one of Windows\u0026rsquo; best features IMO. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to see it make its way to Linux.\nWith Windows constantly shooting itself in the foot, it\u0026rsquo;s fun to see its most useful parts being cherry picked and ported to Linux. Windows\u0026rsquo; loss is Liinux\u0026rsquo;s gain lol. Well, I hope you enjoy this neat little extension\u0026hellip;\nHonorable mention As a bonus, I would like to mention another Tiling extension. But before I mention which, I want you to keep in mind that sometimes this extension, like many others tends to lag behind major Gnome releases, so for example when Gnome 47 lands, you will have to disable it and wait a while before it\u0026rsquo;s updated adding in support.\nNow, with TilingShell covering newcomers from Windows, the extension am talking about here, is none other than Forge, specifically targeted to those coming from a Tiling Window Manager, who prefer that way of doing things.\nTo install it use the aforementioned Extension Manager app. For more information about its features and how to use it, link to project\u0026rsquo;s Git found below.

Ready to turn your Steam Deck into a time machine for classic games? That\u0026rsquo;s where this guide comes in!\nBatocera Batocera is an open-source and completely free retro-gaming distribution that can be copied to a USB stick or an SD card with the aim of turning any computer/nano computer into a gaming console during a game or permanently. Batocera.linux does not require any modification on your computer. Note that you must own the games you play in order to comply with the law.\nbatocera-linux/batocera.linux batocera.linux Python 2833 661 Background Let me start by answering this question, before you ask it. \u0026ldquo;What do you mean by Part 1?\u0026rdquo;. Simple, this guide will be your normal run of the mill about installing Batocera on an SD-Card dual booting it with SteamOS.\n\u0026ldquo;What will you cover in Part 2?\u0026rdquo;. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the moment where you will be rolling your eyes, while you call me a weirdo. Part 2 will cover how to wipe SteamOS replacing it with Batocera on the Deck\u0026rsquo;s internal SSD.\nThe reason why I for one never cared about playing Triple-A games on that thing. Maybe indie games yes, reason being, I never saw any advantage of going from high FPS to extremely low just to justify my purchase. In my eyes the Deck has always been a monster Emulation Machine, no more no less. That\u0026rsquo;s where am gonna leave it. Say what you will, it\u0026rsquo;s my Deck, so I can do with it as I please. Freedom\u0026hellip;\nNow on with the guide eh ?\nWhy Batocera ? Because who doesn’t love a good nostalgia trip? Batocera lets you play retro games on your Steam Deck without messing with your Steam library. It runs off a microSD card, so you can keep your games separate and swap systems effortlessly.\nWhat You Need: Below is a list of things you will need before we proceed. I would recommend 2 cards, one you will be using and another as a backup, just in case something goes wrong.\nMicroSD Card: A fast U3 A2 card for smooth gameplay. Batocera Image: The image we will be using. Balena Etcher: Tool for flashing the image onto the microSD card Steam Deck: Your ultimate gaming device. Step-by-Step Guide 1. Download Batocera:\nFirst things first, head over to the Batocera Site and grab the latest image for the Steam Deck. Make sure you select the correct image for your Steam Deck’s architecture – this is crucial to avoid any hiccups later on.\n2. Install Balena Etcher:\nNext up, we need Balena Etcher. This handy tool will flash the Batocera image onto your microSD card. Download it from Balena\u0026rsquo;s Site, install it on your Steam Deck, and fire it up. It’s super user-friendly, so no need to sweat this part.\n3. Flash Batocera to the microSD Card:\nInsert your microSD card into the Steam Deck or use an external card reader if you have one. Open Balena Etcher, select the Batocera image file you just downloaded, and choose your microSD card as the target. Hit the “Flash!” button and watch the magic happen. This process might take a few minutes, so maybe grab a coffee or do a quick victory dance.\n4. Booting into Batocera:\nOnce the flashing is done, insert the microSD card into your Steam Deck. Now, power on the Deck while holding the volume down button to enter the boot menu. Select the microSD card from the boot options, and voila! You’re booting into Batocera. Welcome to the retro world!\n5. First Time Setup:\nWhen you boot into Batocera for the first time, there are a few housekeeping items to handle:\nConnect to WiFi: Press the Start button, navigate to Network Settings, and enable WiFi. Select your network and enter the password. You’re online and ready to go! Configure Controllers: Most controllers are supported right out of the box. Connect via USB or Bluetooth, then head to Controller Settings to map buttons if needed. Easy peasy. System Language: If you prefer a language other than English, go to System Settings and change the language. Now you can navigate in your language of choice. 6. Adding Your Games:\nThis is where the fun begins. You need to add your game ROMs:\nConnect your Steam Deck to a PC or use the built-in file manager. Transfer your game ROMs to the “share/roms” directory on the microSD card. You can organize them by creating subfolders for each console. Batocera will automatically detect and list your games. It’s like magic! 7. Customizing Batocera:\nNow, let’s make Batocera your own:\nThemes: Go to the UI Settings to change themes and give Batocera a fresh look. There are plenty to choose from, so find one that screams “you.” Shaders: Enhance your gaming experience with graphical shaders. Find them in the Video Settings. They can make your games look even better than you remember. Emulator Settings: Tweak individual emulator settings for optimal performance. This can make a huge difference in how smoothly your games run. A Proper Boot Menu After the initial setup, you might find it annoying to hold down the volume key during boot up. We can make this experience much smoother with a boot menu called Clover.\nInstalling Clover:\nEnsure the Batocera microSD card is in place. Boot into SteamOS and access the Steam desktop. Connect to WiFi if you’re not already connected. Open the Konsole terminal and type the following commands: cd ~/ git clone https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot cd ~/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot chmod +x install-Clover.sh ./install-Clover.sh If prompted to set a sudo password, do so and rerun the script with ./install-Clover.sh. The script will ask for your sudo password and let you choose the default OS (SteamOS is recommended). The script will run automatically, setting up Clover. Once done, you’ll see a boot menu every time you start your Steam Deck, allowing you to select your desired environment. Troubleshooting Tips Running into issues? Here are some quick fixes:\nBatocera Not Booting: Double-check that the image was flashed correctly and the microSD card is properly inserted. Sometimes it’s the simple things. Controller Issues: Make sure your controllers are fully charged and properly paired. If needed, re-map the buttons in Controller Settings. Network Problems: Restart your router or double-check your WiFi settings. Sometimes technology just needs a little nudge. Slow Performance: Consider using a faster microSD card or tweaking emulator settings for better performance. Bonus Tips: Backup microSD: Keep a second card with a fresh Batocera image just in case. You never know when you might need it. Explore Settings: Batocera is packed with customization options. Take some time to explore and tweak settings to your liking. BIOS Files: Some games may require BIOS files. Ensure these are placed in the correct directories for each console. Enjoy your retro gaming adventure on the Steam Deck! With this guide, you\u0026rsquo;re all set to dive into the golden age of gaming. Happy gaming!\nWrapping It Up Before Batocera, my Steam Deck felt like a reliable but joyless workhorse. Installing Batocera changed everything. It transformed my Deck into a retro gaming paradise, making it feel more like the fun, nostalgic handhelds I love. With the retro magic of Batocera and a proper boot menu, my appreciation for the Deck skyrocketed.\nIn short, Batocera brings the joy of retro gaming front and center, making everything feel delightfully vintage and new all at once.\nIf you are looking for a much more detailed guide, might I recommend checking either Wagner\u0026rsquo;s Tech Talk or Retro Handhelds where I sourced most my material from.\nSee you in Part 2, in a couple of weeks when my Steam Deck is back with me, and have tested my methods before bringing you the guide, just so I am as accurate as possible\u0026hellip;.\n","date":"15 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/bato-deck/","section":"","summary":"Hey there, retro gamer!

I stumbled upon this new IDE called ZED, and I thought I\u0026rsquo;d share it with y\u0026rsquo;all.\nThe Linux version has been in development for a while, they just announced its availablability via their \u0026raquo; Linux when? Linux now post\u0026hellip;\nSome Information Zed is a high-performance, open-source code editor built using the Rust programming language. Here are the key points about Zed:\nBuilt with Rust: Zed is written entirely in Rust, a systems programming language known for its speed, safety, and concurrency features. This allows Zed to offer superior performance compared to many other code editors.

Collaborative Coding: Zed supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously from different locations. Customizable: Zed provides a range of customization options, including themes, plugins, and adjustable settings, allowing developers to tailor the editor to their specific needs and workflows. Open-Source: Zed was open-sourced in 2024 and is available under the MIT license, allowing developers to contribute to its development and extend its functionality. Cross-Platform: Zed is currently available for macOS, with plans for Linux support in the future. Windows support is not yet available. In summary, Zed is a modern, high-performance code editor built using the Rust programming language, offering developers a fast, collaborative, and customizable coding experience. Its open-source nature and focus on performance and productivity make it an exciting new option in the code editor landscape.\nExtension Support Zed\u0026rsquo;s extension support is a key aspect of its customizability and flexibility as a code editor. While Zed is built on a robust core, its true power lies in the ability to extend its functionality through a vibrant ecosystem of plugins and extensions.\nDevelopers can tap into a growing library of community-contributed extensions that add support for a wide range of programming languages, integrate with popular tools and services, and enhance the overall coding experience. From syntax highlighting and code formatting to advanced debugging and deployment workflows, Zed\u0026rsquo;s extension system allows users to tailor the editor to their specific needs.\nThe extension system is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a straightforward process for discovering, installing, and managing extensions directly within the Zed interface. This empowers developers to quickly find and implement the tools and features they require, without the need for complex configuration or external setup.\nAs Zed continues to gain traction and attract a dedicated user base, the extension ecosystem is expected to flourish, with more and more developers contributing their own custom extensions and integrations. This extensibility is a key factor that sets Zed apart, allowing it to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of modern software development.\nAssistant integrations Zed\u0026rsquo;s assistant integration is a key feature that allows developers to seamlessly collaborate with AI language models within the code editor. Here are the main points about Zed\u0026rsquo;s assistant capabilities:\nConversational Interface: Zed provides a dedicated assistant editor panel that functions similar to a chat interface. Users can type prompts and queries, and the assistant\u0026rsquo;s responses are displayed in real-time below. Multiple Roles: The assistant editor supports different message blocks for the \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Assistant\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;System\u0026rdquo; roles, allowing for structured conversations and context management. Customizable Models: Zed allows users to select the AI model they want to use, including options like OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s GPT models and Anthropic\u0026rsquo;s Claude. Users can also specify custom API endpoints for the models. Code Interaction: The assistant can interact with code snippets, with users able to easily insert code from the editor into the conversation and have the assistant provide feedback or generate new code. Prompt Library: Zed includes a prompt library feature that allows users to save and reuse custom prompts to guide the assistant\u0026rsquo;s responses, including a \u0026ldquo;default prompt\u0026rdquo; that sets the initial context. Streaming Responses: Responses from the assistant are streamed in real-time, and users can cancel the stream at any point if the response is not what they were expecting. Overall, Zed\u0026rsquo;s assistant integration provides a seamless way for developers to leverage the capabilities of large language models directly within their coding workflow, enhancing productivity and collaboration.\nInstalling \u0026amp; configuring Zed It\u0026rsquo;s available on the Arch Extra Repos, you can easily install it from there via :\nsudo pacman -S --needed zed Configure Zed Use ⌘ + , to open your custom settings to set things like fonts, formatting settings, per-language settings, and more.

It\u0026rsquo;s slowly replacing my current IDE Kate. It\u0026rsquo;s more flexible, cutomizable and most importantly it\u0026rsquo;s got GPU Acceleration where Kate doesn\u0026rsquo;t, at least not as well. Oh it\u0026rsquo;s also super lightweight.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s not as the video says, a 1:1 VSCode replacement, with some lacking features, it\u0026rsquo;s getting there. It\u0026rsquo;s relatively new, so I only see good things in its future, it just needs time to cook.\nHowever, it already includes support for the main plugins I, myself care about, like Git, Docker Compose, Toml, Yaml, Make, Java, Bash, Markdown among others, with more in the pipeline\u0026hellip;This post was written using it BTW\u0026hellip;\nAnd if you know me by now I love its theme engine, with the likes of Dracula, Catppuccin, Nord, Synthwave \u0026lsquo;84 among others already available to install..

However it is possible to install on any other Distro, The package is available on the AUR so we will be installing it from there. Remember that if you have enabled the ChaoticAUR Repo you can use pacman instead. We have written an article on you can do that linked below.\nThe Chaotic-AUR 3 July 2024\u0026middot;2 mins\u0026middot; loading \u0026middot; loading With that out of the way. now we can go ahead and install it with :\nparu -S oh-my-posh-bin Now that it is installed, we need to activate it. In the video above, it was shown on .zshrc but the same can be done for .bashrc. Worry not though, I will be showing both. But before we do that, unlike video, we are not going to create a custom config, you are free to do so, will link you to the project Git at the end of this post where you can follow a more in-depth tutorial. We will be keeping it simple here.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s grab the one we like from \u0026raquo; OMP Theme Repo\nTo grab it we will have to create the folder where we will be storing our selected config. We can do it either via our favorite file manager or Terminal.

For example did you know that even if you have installed it from the AUR/ChaoticAUR, where sometimes they lag behind, you can update it using an internal command ?

This Bash script is all about automation and ease, bringing you through the installation process with a slick TUI interface that’s both stylish and user-friendly.\nArch Linux is legendary for its flexibility and simplicity, but let’s face it, installing it can be a bit of a headache. That’s where Amelia comes in. This nifty tool mixes automation with interactivity, making the installation process a breeze without taking away any control from you, the user.\nFeatures Clocking in at almost 6,000 lines of Bash brilliance, Amelia is designed for modern GPT systems. It uses the Discoverable Partitions Specification to automatically detect and manage partitions, saving you from the dreaded fstab editing. Seriously, who wants to manually edit fstab?\nAmelia is on the cutting edge with its approach to file systems and initialization. For instance, if you’re using ext4, it bypasses the old genfstab command and lets systemd handle the necessary setup. The same goes for initramfs – systemd takes over from the old base and udev combo, streamlining everything.\nBut don’t worry, control freaks! Amelia keeps you in the driver’s seat with interactive, menu-driven prompts that guide you through every step.\nDisk Management For handling disks, Amelia uses cgdisk, which provides a pseudo-GUI that’s both powerful and easy to use. It makes partition management safe and straightforward.\nAmelia lets you make all the important decisions, asking for confirmation at each critical juncture. This ensures you’re always informed and in control, minimizing the risk of any unwanted surprises.\nWith a detailed menu system, you can personalize, configure your system, and manage disks with ease. Pick your locale, keyboard layout, and optimize your system for different desktop environments like KDE Plasma, GNOME, or Xfce.\nAdvanced users will appreciate options for kernel selection and EFI boot management. Before kicking off the installation, Amelia checks for UEFI mode, internet connectivity, and updates the system clock to keep everything in sync.\nFor the pros, Amelia offers features like LUKS encryption for disk partitions and customization of the pacstrap process. Depending on your level of expertise and preferences, you can choose between automatic or manual partitioning and installation modes.\nGetting Started with Amelia Ready to dive in ? First, boot up from the Arch live ISO image. Once you see the shell prompt, download Amelia with this simple Curl command:\ncurl -O https://gitlab.com/prism7/archery/-/raw/main/Amelia.sh Make sure you’ve got a working internet connection. Then, fire up the script and follow the prompts:\nsh Amelia.sh When the installation wraps up, you’ll get a confirmation screen. Reboot your computer, and voila – your shiny new Arch Linux system is ready to roll.\nFinal Thoughts Amelia is a powerhouse when it comes to installing Arch Linux. But let’s set expectations – this tool is geared towards experienced users, not beginners. Its main goal is to save time for those who already know their way around an Arch installation.\nIf you’re expecting a step-by-step hand-holding experience, you might be disappointed. A solid understanding of partition types and manual setup is still required, especially for disk partitioning.\nI managed to set up Arch with a KDE Plasma desktop in just 20 minutes, thanks to Amelia. However, there were a few hiccups. We ran into issues with missing Plasma packages, with unnecessary ones being installed.\nAnother thing we did not like so much that we feel that might push new users away is the fact that when we selected the regular Plasma profile, it offered a selective install for every group, which we feel might overwhelm users, especially ones who have no idea what each package does.\nOne cool feature, however, is that Amelia includes ViM/NeoViM that most Devs out there might appreciate.\nIn summary, Amelia is a fantastic tool for streamlining the Arch Linux installation process. It’s a huge time-saver for seasoned users, handling much of the manual setup automatically.\nFor those of you still nervous about installing Arch, don’t fret – this script comes to the rescue.\nFor more details on Amelia, check out its GitLab page.\nPrism7 / archery 37 1 ","date":"7 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/amelia-automated-archinstall/","section":"","summary":"Overview Meet Amelia – your new best friend for installing ArchLinux!

You can use one of the presupplied images like Bazzite (gaming-focused image), Bluefin (general use zero-manitenance image), Aurora or their base images with minimal customizations to vanilla kinoite/silverblue/etc.\nWhat is Aurora? Before explaining it, I would like to answer the \u0026ldquo;Why Aurora ?\u0026rdquo; question, well in case you did not know it yet, I am a KDE Plasma shill, so why not Aurora ? LoL. Now on to what it is\u0026hellip;\nAurora is Bluefin but with another coat of paint, the KDE Desktop. Many people love and cherish GNOME, but others want the customizability or the looks of a vanilla KDE experience. For those people, Aurora is here to serve them that need!\nublue-os/bluefin The next generation Linux workstation, designed for reliability, performance, and sustainability. Shell 2225 249 It includes everything that makes Bluefin and Bluefin-DX so awesome, including brew on host, the bluefin-cli, the starship CLI experience, Tailscale and the container-native Ptyxis terminal. You’ll find that most of the things you’re used to in Bluefin are the same under the hood, including the just commands. Aurora is not designed to be a drastically different experience than Bluefin, which also means we (I) can keep it regularly in sync with upstream so you get the latest changes.\nIt is built on the kinoite-main Images. The images feature almost no customization, aside from some quality of life features and some branding. You can expect a vanilla KDE experience with developer batteries under the hood.\nThe upsides / benefits An Awesome Package Manager I will begin by saying this, it\u0026rsquo;s a neat project, I love how they use their sorta package manager called ujust that reminds me a heck of a lot of Topgrade which handles everything.\nTopgrade AiO Updater 26 June 2024\u0026middot;3 mins\u0026middot; loading \u0026middot; loading Pre-Bundled Scripts Not just that, but they also supply so many pre-configured scripts that make harder tasks on other distros so damn simple, it\u0026rsquo;s not even funny. They even supply an image with the nVidia or AMD drivers baked it and pre-configured for you so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to lift a finger.\nStability and Immunability Also, the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s so stable with truly almost zero-maintenance needed by you the user is a Huge benefit. Especially that it uses rpm-ostree. And that it\u0026rsquo;s immune to any mistakes you might make, is so awesome. If you break the system just reboot select an older snapshot and you are back up and running. However one can still break it, but you really have to try lol.\nThey even supply an image for us devs out there with all the tools we might need to be productive out the box. I mean wow, could there be any more handholding ?\nThe Downsides (No Dealbreakers) Too Much Cruft ? Which brings me to the only Big downside, which is in my humble opinion, that it has way too much out the box, even the simple version. I get it, it aims to be as out of one\u0026rsquo;s way as possible letting us be more productive, while I agree with this, it tends to target a smaller audience. Coz not everyone wants or needs everything it provides. I mean we don\u0026rsquo;t even get to choose what we want out the box, ending up having to remove the cruft we do not need. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s more of a Fedora limitation I do not know.\nLaziness / No Self-Reliance Now this is much less of an issue, more of an obervation, but if I have learned something during my Distro Maintaining days, it\u0026rsquo;s that doing too much for the user out the box, will make them both lazy and will end up too dependent on us devs/maintainers. While I can\u0026rsquo;t speak for the team behind uBlue, it\u0026rsquo;s just impossible to satisfy everyone.\nNo Freedom To Tinker The other downside to this whole idea of Atomic distros, is that, if you were a tinkerer like me, who loves to mess with the system, modify core functionalities, you simply can\u0026rsquo;t. As such you will be heavily relying on Flatpaks. It\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal though, since this project wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be used that way, so am not gonna be docking it any points for that.\nWould I recommend it ? In conclusion, I will say, this is my opinion, and that you should take it with a huge grain of salt. I am a tinkerer, a not so ordinary user so to speak. And I have only been using it a day as of the writing of this post.\nBut yes, of ourse I would Highly recommend you at least give it a try. Just make sure to select the version that works best for you. Be it AMD, nVidia, or the Dev/DX version.\nJust make sure you know that you will not be able to tinker much with it, the way you would be able to with the likes of Arch or the likes.\nAs for me, nope it will not replace my daily driver, ArchLinux, nothing will, I prefer my freedom for tinkering with the system. I was just curious as to what the deal was with all the Atomic distros out there is all.\nDownload Bluefin Aurora That’s it folks ..\nCheers !\n","date":"1 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/aurora-atomic/","section":"","summary":"What is uBlue Atomic? uBlue is a project which produces images based on Fedora Atomic distros.

When you change root to another directory you cannot access files and commands outside that directory. This directory is called a “chroot jail”. Changing root is commonly done for system maintenance for such tasks as reinstalling GRUB or resetting a forgotten password. Changing root is often done from a LiveCD or LiveUSB into a mounted partition that contains an installed system.\nRequirements You’ll need to boot to another working Linux environment (for example, to a LiveCD or USB flash disk). Root privileges are required in order to chroot. Be sure that the architectures of the Linux environment you have booted into matches the architecture of the root directory you wish to enter (i.e. i686, x86_64). You can find the architecture of your current environment by: uname -m If you need any kernel modules loaded in the chroot environment, load them before chrooting. It may also be useful to initialize your swap (swapon /dev/\u0026lt;device-or-partition-name\u0026gt;) and to connect to your network before chrooting. Mounting the device The device or partition with the Linux system on it will need to be mounted. To discover the kernel name of the storage device name, type:\nfdisk -l Create a directory where you would like to mount the device or partition, then mount it:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/xero sudo mount /dev/device_or_partition_name /mnt/xero For LUKS encrypted devices, mount won’t work, use udisksctl instead, first unlock the device (all commands as regular user):\nsudo udisksctl unlock -b /dev/device_or_partition_name Get the device mapper name:\nls - la /dev/mapper then mount the returned mapper:\nudiskctl mount -b /dev/mapper/mapper_name Changing Root Mount the temporary filesystems:\ncd /mnt/xero sudo mount -t proc proc proc/ sudo mount -t sysfs sys sys/ sudo mount -o bind /dev dev/ Mount other parts of your filesystem (e.g. /boot, /var, /usr…) that reside on separate partitions but which you need access to. For example:\nsudo mount /dev/device_or_partition_name boot/ It’s possible to mount filesystems after you’ve chrooted, but it’s more convenient to do so beforehand. The reasoning for this is you’ll have to unmount the temporary filesystems after you exit a chroot so this lets you unmount all the filesystems in a single command. This also allows a safer shutdown. Because the external Linux environment knows all mounted partitions it can safely unmount them during shutdown.\nIf you’ve setup your network and want to use it in the chroot environment, copy over your DNS servers so that you will be connected to the network:\ncp -L /etc/resolv.conf etc/resolv.conf Now chroot to your installed device or partition and define your shell:\nsudo chroot . /bin/bash If you see the error, chroot: cannot run command '/bin/bash': Exec format error it is likely the two architectures do not match.\nIf you’ll be doing anything with GRUB inside the chroot environment, you’ll need to be sure your /etc/mtab is up-to-date:\nsudo rm /etc/mtab \u0026amp;\u0026amp; grep -v rootfs /proc/mounts \u0026gt; /etc/mtab If you use bash, your root $HOME/.bashrc will be sourced on login provided your ~/.bash_profile specifies it (source ~/.bashrc). To source your chrooted, global bash configuration do:\nsource /etc/profile If your bash configuration doesn’t use a unique prompt, consider creating one to be able to differentiate your chroot environment:\nexport PS1=\u0026#34;(chroot) $PS1\u0026#34; Perform System Maintenance At this point you can perform whatever system maintenance you require inside the chroot environment, some common examples being:\nUpgrade or downgrade packages Rebuild your initcpio image Reset a forgotten password Fix your /etc/fstab Reinstall GRUB With this information, you are able to arch-chroot, and to be able to do that you need to have root permissions, so type the following command:\nThen type the following:\nsudo arch-chroot /mnt/xero Now you’ve chrooted into your installed system, and you are able to access your files, install packages, or alter scripts to rescue your system.\nTo make sure arch-chroot is working check after your users home folder ls /home that should give your username from the installed system.\nExiting chroot When you’re finished with system maintenance, exit the chroot shell:\nexit Then unmount the temporary filesystems and any mounted devices:\numount {proc,sys,dev,boot...} Finally attempt to unmount your hard drive:\ncd ..umount xero/ If you get an error saying that \u0026lsquo;/mnt\u0026rsquo; (or any other partition) is busy, this can mean one of two things:\nA program was left running inside of the chroot. Or more frequently: a sub-mount still exists. For example, /mnt/xero/usr within /mnt/xero. In the latter case, unmount the sub-mount mount point first. To get a reminder of all the current mount points, run mount with no parameters. If you still are unable to unmount a partition, use the force option:\numount -f /mnt After this you will be able to safely reboot.\n","date":"27 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/chroot-guide/","section":"","summary":"Info Changing Root (Chroot) is the process of changing of the apparent disk root directory (and the current running process and its children) to another root directory.

Hopefully a video showing it in action soon. In this short tutorial we will be using the Docker Compose feature to deploy our containers. Just note we can do so much more, but this is just an introductory guide, you will have to discover the rest on your own. It\u0026rsquo;s so much fun trust me. To get an idea how much I love them click Here to read my thoughts\u0026hellip;\nSo without further delay let\u0026rsquo;s gooooooooo\u0026hellip;\nWhat are Docker containers ? Docker containers are lightweight, portable units that package an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent performance across different environments. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient and faster to start.\nKey Points: Isolation: Containers run in isolated environments, using the host system’s resources without interference. Portability: Containers can be run anywhere with Docker installed, solving the \u0026ldquo;it works on my machine\u0026rdquo; issue. Efficiency: They use fewer resources than VMs since they don’t need a full OS for each instance. Consistency: Ensures the same environment across development, testing, and production. Scalability: Easily scalable with tools like Kubernetes, perfect for microservices. How It Works: Dockerfile: Script defining how to build a Docker image. Build: Create an image from the Dockerfile. Run: Start a container from the image. Manage: Use Docker commands to handle the container lifecycle. Docker containers streamline development, improve resource utilization, and simplify deployment, making them ideal for modern application development.\nInstall Docker Package Before we can deploy our container(s) we will need to install docker and its dependencies then enable the service. To do so type this in terminal (ArchLinux) :\nsudo pacman -S docker docker-compose Now that we have Docker installed we will need to add ourselves to the Docker group and start the service. Do it like this :\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER sudo systemctl enable --now docker Docker Compose file (Stack) Ok, now that everything\u0026rsquo;s set, we can go container hunting\u0026hellip; I would highly recommend sites like, SelfH or AwesomeSelfHosted. But for the sake of this tutorial, I will be showing you an example docker compose file from one of the services found there. I have selected FileBrowser (User : demo / Pass : demo)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the docker compose file contents. Just create a folder called \u0026ldquo;FileBrowser\u0026rdquo;, then inside it a file called \u0026ldquo;compose.yml\u0026rdquo; inside it paste the following :\nservices: filebrowser: image: hurlenko/filebrowser user: \u0026#34;1000:1000\u0026#34; ports: - 443:8080 volumes: - /\u0026lt;path-to-shared-folder\u0026gt;:/data - ./config:/config environment: - FB_BASEURL=/ restart: always Just make sure to change the \u0026ldquo;443\u0026rdquo; port to one you prefer without touching part to the right which is the internal Docker one. Also in the \u0026ldquo;Volumes\u0026rdquo; section change the \u0026ldquo;- /:/data\u0026rdquo; part, do not modify right side just the left, before the \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo;, and set it to what you want to share between your machines. DO NOT SHARE ROOT ! At least if you are going to make it public. If you want to keep it internal like me, do it if you so wish it\u0026rsquo;s up to you.\nNow save the file, and open Terminal inside the folder and run the following command to start it as a Daemon :\ndocker compose up -d If all was done correctly, you will now be able to access your newly created container via following URLs :\nhttp://localhost:443 (Same machine container is on) http://\u0026lt;server-ip\u0026gt;:443 (From other machines on same network) Updating Docker Images Deploying them images (containers) is nice and all, but now we need to maintain them, as in make sure they are up-to-date. In order to do so, we need to navigate to their respective folders, open terminal there, and run the following commands (FileBrowser) :\ndocker compose down (Stop Container) docker compose pull (Pull in latest version) docker compose up -d (Start it up again) Note :\nKeep in mind that some containers might require us to delete them before grabbing new version. Make sure to read their instructions on that before going forward. I just used what works for our example. Not all Containers function the same way\u0026hellip;\nOther tools\u0026hellip; Kindly note that there are other tools we could use to make deployment much simpler. I just haven\u0026rsquo;t used them in this guide so you can see how it all works. Tools that can be used are, Portainer and Dockge, among many others\u0026hellip;\nNginx Proxy \u0026amp; More\u0026hellip; So far what we have done here, is deploy container for local access. If you want to access it outside your Network, well, for this you will have to own your own Domain name, set up Nginx Proxy manager, use Cloudflare and so on. But that\u0026rsquo;s for another day.

It downloads a .flatpakref file and then you’ll have to use the command line to install from the flatpakref file.\nIf you have to use the command line ultimately, it doesn’t make sense to download the flatpakref file.\nYou can make things better by using Flatline. It’s a Browser extension and it makes that Install button useful by converting it into appstream link.\nThis way, when you click on the Install button for any application on the Flathub website, it will ask you to open the link in an XDG application like the Software Center.\nGrab it for Firefox -\u0026gt; Firefox Add-on Grab it for Chromium Browsers -\u0026gt; Chrome Extension This also means that you should have Fltapak support integrated into the software center.\nManage Flatpak permissions graphically With Flatseal Flatseal is a graphical utility to review and modify your Flatpak applications’ permissions. This makes things a lot easier than going through the commands.\nIt lists all the installed Flatpak applications and shows what kind of permissions the selected application has.\nYou may enable or disable the permissions. Please bear in mind that disabling some permissions might impact the normal functioning of the application. You should know what you are doing.\nApply GTK system themes to Flatpak applications You might have already noticed that most Flatpak apps don’t change their appearance as per the current system theme.\nWhy? Because Flatpak apps run inside a ‘container’ and don’t have access to the host filesystem, network, or physical devices.\nYou can choose to install themes as Flatpak to solve this issue. However, your favorite theme might not be available in Flatpak format.\nAlternatively, you can make some manual effort and force the Flatpak applications to use a given theme. Check This Thread to know more\u0026hellip;\nUpdate Flatpak apps and clean them This is more for Flatpak unfriendly distributions like Ubuntu. If your distro doesn’t come baked in with Flatpak and you don’t have it integrated with the Software center, your installed Flatpak apps won’t be updated with system updates.\nYou can update all your installed Flatpak apps simultaneously with:\nflatpak update Conclusion Flatpak should be the one and only method to deliver apps. Please note I said \u0026ldquo;Apps\u0026rdquo;. There are things that can never be delivered as Flatpaks, like DEs and WMs, among many system related, like Tweaks, Themes, Kernels etc..

Yay \u0026amp; Paru are AUR Helpers. What\u0026rsquo;s that ? Well, an AUR helper is a tool that automates the process of installing and managing packages from the Arch User Repository (AUR) on Arch Linux. The main purpose of AUR helpers is to simplify the installation and updating of AUR packages, which are not available in the official Arch Linux repositories\nWhat is the difference between the two ? The primary differences between the AUR helpers Yay and Paru lie in their underlying programming languages and some of their default settings and features. Yay is written in Go, while Paru is implemented in the more efficient Rust language, resulting in better performance. Additionally, Paru has some saner default settings, such as requiring users to review the PKGBUILD before installing a package, which is an important security consideration when working with the Arch User Repository. Yay, on the other hand, offers a unique \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;combinedupgrade\u0026rdquo; flag that provides a color-coded output to distinguish between repository and AUR package upgrades, a feature not present in Paru. In terms of active development, Paru is currently more actively maintained than Yay, though both continue to receive updates and improvements. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to personal preference and specific needs when managing packages from the AUR..\nYay Installation : cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git cd ~/yay-bin/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; makepkg -rsi --noconfirm cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -Rf ~/yay-bin/ Yay Configuration : yay -Y --devel --save \u0026amp;\u0026amp; yay -Y --gendb sed -i \u0026#39;s/\u0026#34;sudoloop\u0026#34;: false/\u0026#34;sudoloop\u0026#34;: true/\u0026#39; ~/.config/yay/config.json; Anyway here\u0026rsquo;s how to proceed for Paru\u0026hellip;\nParu Installation : cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru-bin.git cd ~/paru-bin/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; makepkg -rsi --noconfirm cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -Rf ~/paru-bin/ Paru Configuration : sudo sed -i -e \u0026#39;s/^#BottomUp/BottomUp/\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/^#SudoLoop/SudoLoop/\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/^#CombinedUpgrade/CombinedUpgrade/\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/^#UpgradeMenu/UpgradeMenu/\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/^#NewsOnUpgrade/NewsOnUpgrade/\u0026#39; /etc/paru.conf echo \u0026#34;SkipReview\u0026#34; | sudo tee -a /etc/paru.conf \u0026gt; /dev/null paru --gendb; Closing Once that is done, you can use it to start installing packages from the AUR.

I found a guide that I will be sharing with you all\u0026hellip;\nApps built with Q (aka KDE apps) do not look great on the XFCE4 \u0026amp; GNOME desktop because they don’t respect the default theme. The way to fix this is to use Kvantum. With it, you can set KDE app themes to use a similar theme to what you use.\nBefore we begin\u0026hellip; In this guide, we’ll be using the Adapta GTK theme for XFCE. We’re focusing on Adapta because it has a Kvantum theme that is widely available and helps blend KDE apps in with XFCE4 quite well.\nBefore starting this guide, we highly recommend installing the Adapta GTK theme onto your Linux PC and enabling it as the default theme in XFCE.\nInstalling Kvantum on Linux To get Kvantum working on your Linux PC, you will need to install it alongside the management tool. To get started, open up a terminal window and install the Kvantum manager, as well as everything else necessary to use it.\nArch Linux\nKvantum is available to Arch Linux users and has been for a very long time. There is an AUR package. There’s also a package in the official Arch Linux software sources, which we recommend.\nTo get the latest Kvantum on your Arch Linux PC, enter the following terminal command.\nsudo pacman -S kvantum Downloading Kvantum themes\nIn this guide, we’re focusing on the Kvantum Adapta theme. However, if you want to use a different GTK theme and need a matching Kvantum theme to go with it, the best place to go is the KDE Store.\nThe KDE Store has tons of stuff to download, including Kvantum theme engine themes. To download a Kvantum theme, head over to the Kvantum page on the KDE store. From there, look through the latest themes to download.\nOnce you’ve downloaded a theme, launch Kvantum Manager, select “Install/Update Theme,” and install it. Then, select “Change/Delete Theme” to start using it on your system.\nUsing Kvantum to make KDE apps look better To make your KDE apps look better on the XFCE4 desktop, start by launching “Kvantum Manager” from the app menu. If you cannot find it in the app menu, open up the XFCE4 quick launcher with Alt + F2, and enter “kvantummanager” in the launch box.\nOnce the Kvantum Manager app is open on the XFCE4 desktop, follow the step-by-step instructions outlined below.\n- Step 1: Locate the “Change/Delete Theme” option in the Kvantum Manager. If you cannot find it, it is directly below the “Install/Update Theme.”\nAfter selecting the “Change/Delete Theme” button, you will see a menu that says “Select a theme,” followed by a blank text box. Change it to “Kvdapta.”\n- Step 2: Open up a terminal window and install the Qt5ct app.\nsudo pacman -S qt5ct - Step 3: Open up a terminal window and use the echo command to edit the profile file to add the environmental variable.\necho \u0026#34;export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.profile - Step 4: Log out of your XFCE 4 session and log back in.\n- Step 5: Open up Qt5ct via the app menu. Or, launch it via the terminal with the qt5ct command.\nStep 6: Locate the “Appearance” tab. Then, find the “Style” menu. In the menu, select “kvantum.” Then, select “Apply” to apply changes.\nUpon applying your changes, KDE applications on XFCE 4 should be using the Kvantum theme set up earlier. This method works the same way on both XFCE \u0026amp; GNOME.\nGuide by: AddictiveTips.com\n","date":"27 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/theme-qt-apps-on-gtk-de/","section":"","summary":"Intro As I was working on XFCE \u0026 Gnome, I noticed that since they both use GTK3/4, some Qt apps made for KDE like KdenLive did not follow the system theme.

The markdownify library is used to convert HTML to Markdown. Extract Content: The script extracts the main content of the post by looking for the div with class post_body. Convert to Markdown: The script uses the markdownify library to convert the HTML content to Markdown and processes embedded YouTube videos. Save to File: The script saves each converted post to its own Markdown file. The filenames are derived from the thread IDs in the URLs. Output Directory: The script creates an output_dir directory if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist and saves the Markdown files there. How to Run the Script Save the Script: Copy the script into a file named forum_to_markdown.py. Make sure you mark script as executable via chmod +x forum_to_markdown.py Run the Script: Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal: python forum_to_markdown.py This script will output each post to its own Markdown file in the markdown_posts directory.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for now.

This makes the applications look out of the place in your otherwise beautiful set up.\nThe official way to apply GTK themes to Flatpak apps is by installing the desired theme as a flatpak. However, there are only a few GTK themes that can be installed as Flatpak.\nThis means that if you found a beautiful GTK theme, your Flatpak applications will still be using their default appearance. But wait! There is a workaround.\nTutorial In this tutorial, I am going to introduce you a way to make Flatpak apps aware of external GTK themes.\nTo enable this functionality, users need to install the GTK themes similar to the one used in KDE (as for other distros) but also run these commands:\n- Step 1: Give Flatpak apps access to GTK themes location\nGTK themes are located in /usr/share/themes for all users, and in ~/.themes for a specific user. Notice that you can’t give access to /usr/share/themes because according to Flatpak Documentation they are blacklisted.\nSo, since all included GTK Themes in XeroLinux are located under /usr/share/themes which Flatpaks cannot access we need to copy them to ~/.themes .\nOnce that is done, to give all flatpak packages permission to access ~/.themes run the following command:\nsudo flatpak override --filesystem=$HOME/.themes - Step 2: Enable System-Wide Flatpak Override\nNow we need to apply a system-wide override telling Flatpaks to use whatever GTK theme system is using, it will be applied by default on next release of XeroLinux if it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been already..\nCommands :\nsudo flatpak override --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0:ro sudo flatpak override --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-4.0:ro Also sometimes that alone might not work, so you will need to set specific theme via\u0026hellip;\nsudo flatpak override org.gnome.Calculator --env=GTK_THEME=name-of-gtk-theme Once that\u0026rsquo;s done you will end up with a file in the system that includes those values. Seemingly enough there is some info about that exact issue on the Flathub iisue reporter..\nAs you can see in the screenshot below, there is two themes available, Ant-Bloody and Orchis-dark. Copy and paste the exact theme name in the above command:\nThis only applies to GTK3/4 based packages, for QT in most cases nothing needs to be done Wink Here\u0026rsquo;s the Original Thread on Manjaro Forums\u0026hellip; Oh and This Thread Too\u0026hellip;.\n","date":"27 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/flatpak-theming/","section":"","summary":"Intro One of the reasons why some users avoid installing Flatpak apps is that most Flatpak apps don’t change their appearance as per the current system theme.

After some research I stumbled upon an AiO Installer Script by the famous TKG\u0026hellip;\nWhat is it? What that script does is actually very simple, it gives the you, the user, an option to install various versions of the nVidia drivers. Meaning that if you are using one that requires an older version you can install it, or if you need a specific one that is more compatible you can do that too..\nYou can also select to install the DKMS version in the case where you are using a custom kernel other than LTS or Zen\u0026hellip;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quote from the man himself:\nLIBGLVND compatible, with 32 bit libs and DKMS enabled out of the box (you will still be asked if you want to use the regular package). Installs for all currently installed kernels. Comes with custom patches to enhance kernel compatibility, dynamically applied when you\u0026rsquo;re requesting a driver that\u0026rsquo;s not compatible OOTB with your currently installed kernel(s). Unwanted packages can be disabled with switches in the PKGBUILD. Defaults to complete installation.\nDKMS or regular? DKMS is recommended as it allows for automatic module rebuilding on kernel updates. As long as you\u0026rsquo;re on the same major version (5.8.x for example), you won\u0026rsquo;t need to regenerate the packages on updates, which is a huge QoL feature. Regular modules can also be problematic on Manjaro due to differences in kernel hooking mechanisms compared to Arch. So if in doubt, go DKMS.\nFrogging GitHUB Well, now that you know more click the button below to get teleported to his GitHub where you will find more info and instructions on how to build and install the drivers.\nFrogging-Family/nvidia-all Nvidia driver latest to 396 series AIO installer Shell 916 75 Useful or a dud?

People have asked me many times what USB tool I use to make bootable Linux drives. Well that should answer that question.\nBut before I dive deeper into the why I use it over others here some info to get started.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Ventoy exactly? Ventoy creates bootable USB devices using ISO images. That sounds an awful lot like what established programs such as Rufus do at first, but when you realize that it puts the ISO images on the drive and does not extract them, it becomes interesting.\nEven better, it is possible to place multiple ISO images on the USB device after it has been prepared by Ventoy; this allows you to boot into different Linux systems or install different versions of Windows straight from a single USB device.\nVentoy even supports Secure Boot. Other than that it also includes support for changing the filesystem of the first partition (ntfs/udf/xfs/ext2/ext3/ext4), persistence support for various Linux distributions such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint, and support for auto-installation.\nTheme Support Also, since it uses GRUB, naturally, you can theme it. Yes, you read that correctly, it uses Grub themes, so if there’s a theme you like and use, you can apply it to Ventoy. This tool is my go-to as I have so many ISOs and it saves me time and frustration of having to flash a 2GB ISO on one of my 128GB thumb drives wasting space in the process.\nI absolutely love this thing. It’s actively being updated. Adding more features, fixing others, and baking in support for more Distros. Just make sure to update the USB stick after updating the app itself, because updating the app alone does not magically update USB. You will have to do that yourself via a small terminal command. Click button below to visit the site and read documentation.\nNote: Ventoy is available as an optional tool in XeroLinux, so no need to download from the official site, or if you are on a different Arch-based distro just grab it from AUR otherwise I think it’s available on Debian repos.\nHow to get it ? Well, there are multiple way to grab this awesome tool, but since we mostly target ArchLinux over here I will let you know how to get it for this specific Distro.

In the old days, you might upgrade certain pieces of software, but mostly you would wait until you bought the next version of your distro of choice. Then you’d install it and marvel at the upgraded software.\nPackage management systems have made this easy, but they can’t update every part of your system. What about Ruby Gems or packages you installed via a third-party package manager like Linuxbrew? How will you keep your configuration files synced?\nWhat Is Topgrade ? You can get a clue of just what Topgrade is meant to do by looking at its GitHub page. Its slogan, written at the top of the page, is “upgrade everything.” That’s exactly what it is meant to do.\nWhile we’re focusing on Linux here, Topgrade also works on macOS and Windows. Topgrade is written in Rust, so it should be rather speedy. It’s also licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0, so it’s free as in libre, not just free of charge.\nWhat Does Topgrade Update ? On Linux it will upgrade your system via its package manager, but that’s just the beginning. It will also upgrade Ruby Gems, Atom packages, Linuxbrew and nix packages, and more. It also upgrades apps installed via Snap or Flatpak. This is far from everything, but it should give you an idea.\nTopgrade can also upgrade a large portion of your configuration files. It will upgrade your Vim or Neovim configuration if you use NeoBundle, Vundle, Plug, or Dein. If you use a Git repository for your dotfiles, it will also pull any recent changes to them.\nYou can also add custom commands for Topgrade to run while upgrading. This is handy if you use some custom scripts you’d like to keep automatically updated.\nInstalling Topgrade If you run Vanilla Arch, Topgrade is available via the AUR package. Fortunately, this is fairly easy. On XeroLinux, you can install it with the following commands:\nparu -S topgrade-bin Using Topgrade Now that Topgrade is installed, keeping your system up to date is easy. To run Topgrade’s basic update steps, just run the command:\ntopgrade If you want to add some custom commands or tweak how Topgrade works, you’ll need to edit its configuration file. On Linux, this is located at ~/.config/topgrade.toml For example, if you have a list of Git repositories you’d like to refresh, add the following to the file:\ngit-repos = [ \u0026#34;~/my-repos/repo_name\u0026#34;, ] For more information on tweaking the configuration file, see the Customization section on the Topgrade GitHub page below.\ntopgrade-rs/topgrade Upgrade all the things Rust 3259 207 Conclusion Topgrade gives you a ton of power when it comes to keeping your system up to date. That said, it may be overkill if you just want to keep your system up to date and secure.

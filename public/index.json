I love ricing my setups. I hated that macOS \u0026amp; Windows did not allow this.\nAnd if you want to see what I have managed to do, well, hop on over to my Layan rice\u0026rsquo;s Githup repository, you will get blown away.\nxerolinux/xero-layan-git XeroLinux Layan Rice QML 69 11 A bit of understanding # Ricing can be a bit invloved. At least if you are like me, and care about consistency. It\u0026rsquo;s not about just slapping a desktop theme and calling it a day. That\u0026rsquo;s just lazy. Please don\u0026rsquo;t do that.\nKDE Plasma is a ricing a beast, no doubt about that. That\u0026rsquo;s one of its biggest selling points. So it\u0026rsquo;s normal when I say, it can be very, very intricate. You can rice everything in it.\nWe need to also know what library the system uses. KDE uses a library called Qt, pronounced like cute. But you might encounter apps that use the GTK2/3/4 library, typically ones created for Gnome or XFCE.\nKeep in mind though, to successfully theme GTK4 or, as it\u0026rsquo;s called now LibAdwaita, we need to make sure the necessary Hacks are included in the theme we have chosen, simply because, as we all know, Gnome devs despise the whole idea of theming for whatever reason.\nSo it will be up to you, the user, to find all theme elements required for a complete and consistent look. Whay do I say this you may ask? Well, quite simply because, and it saddens me to say this, very few themes come complete, allowing such consistency. But it can be done.\nWith that out of the way, let\u0026rsquo;s get to it shall we ?\nKDE Plasma pieces # As I said earlier in the post, KDE Plasma is made of many elements that can be themed or riced. So here, I will be explaining what they are and the tools we need to theme them.\nFriendly Advice : Never install themes from any repos or the AUR. Always grab them from source, after you have inspected the code. For your own sanity. And make sure they are compatible with Plasma 6. Please read the above warning, ignoring it will result in nothing but headaches. Trust me, I made that mistake and wasted more time than I can count trying to solve the resulting issues.\nKvantum Manager First, we will need and app that I highly recommend to have on hand, called Kvantum. I consider it an essantial tool for every ricer out there.\ntsujan/Kvantum A Linux SVG-based theme engine for Qt and KDE C\u0026#43;\u0026#43; 1540 145 This will take care of the awesome window blur and transparency effects for all Qt based apps. It will not work on anything else, keep that in mind.\nSDDM Login Manager Another element KDE Plasma uses, is SDDM for its Display Manager/Login.\nIt too can be themed.\nGrub Bootloader Now, I can already hear you say that this is unrelated to KDE Plasma, to which I will say, yes I agree. Also, not everyone will be using Grub. Also true.\nBut for the sake of completeness, I do like to theme it as well.\nKonsole Terminal Emulator Konsole is the Terminal Emulator that Plasma ships. I know most of you switch to Alacritty or even Kitty. But I prefer to stick with what ships with the DE I use.\nThat too can be themed.\nThe more complete the better # Now that we have an understanding of the various elements that make for a more complete experience, here\u0026rsquo;s what themes we choose need to have before using them.\nNot all of them contain all the elements. Sadly there are some out there that are incomplete making it harder to get a cohesive look. So I would avoid those if I were you.\nOnce we have found a noce theme, we need to make sure it applies to the following parts of Plasma :\nColors : Resposible for accent and window colors. Application Style : Theme specific Kvantum style. Plasma Style : Light/Dark window style. Window Decorations : The top window minimize/close/maximize bar. Cursors : Cursor theme (Optional) Icons : A fitting icon theme. (Optional) SDDM : Login theme. That\u0026rsquo;s it really. In case you do not find a theme that contains all these elements, it\u0026rsquo;s not a huge issue, you can always hunt for one that fits the Global Theme. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to find one I know, but who knows you might get lucky lol.\nApplying our themes # Once you have downloaded your chosen theme and theme elements from their sources (Github/Gitlab), follow their respective guides to install them, then head on over to the KDE Settings to apply them.\nFor Kvantum, just launch it, select the theme from the drop down and hit apply. Then select it as the Application Style.\nAs for Konsole, launch it, make sure you have moved its theme file into ~/.local/share/konsole/ folder, right click inside its window, select create new profile from the context menu, give it a name, one that you recognize, on the left click on appearance, select your theme, if you want to enable transparency with blur, click on edit, this is where you do that. Confirm, done.\nNow I will not talk about Grub here since all themes for it will come with their own instructions and/or install scripts.\nPanel \u0026amp; Widgets # Oh boy, the reason I will not be talking about those is is simple, it\u0026rsquo;s your rice you do with those as you please. KDE Plasma comes with some awesome widgets, use those to get started, if you want more, well, you will find them on the KDE Store.\nWarning : Please make sure they are compatible with Plasma 6. As for the panel, position it wherever your heart desires. Top, bottom, left or right. It\u0026rsquo;s all up to you. You can even use it as a Dock. Above is the end result of my very own rice I call the XeroLayan rice.\nBonus for the G33ks # As a bonus, for all the G33ks out there, I would like to include a nice find. Some of us would love to make our rices reproduce-able without having to apply every element over and over, others just want to have a backup.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s where this Github Repo comes in handy. It shows us what files are affected by the various theme elements. So have at it and enjoy !\nshalva97/kde-configuration-files KDE plasma configuration files Shell 766 52 Don\u0026rsquo;t forget about Konsave the GUI tool that does exactly that, just in a much simpler way.

But I thought this one requires your attention, so there you go. It\u0026rsquo;s not news as much as it is an awareness post, letting you know more about what\u0026rsquo;s going on in Immich land.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Immich ? # Immich, is an open-source self-hosted photo and video backup solution, it has captured many users’ hearts worldwide and recently celebrated a remarkable achievement: reaching 40,000 stars on GitHub. For reference, in April 2022, the number was just 1,000.\ncontroversial Feature # In a previous update, version 1.109, Immich, has unveiled a new initiative to enhance support for its development and upkeep. Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown of the changes.\nIt introduced two types of licenses with this update:\nA Server License and the Individual License. Priced at $99.99, is suitable for extensive setups as it covers all users on a single server. An Individual License, costing $24.99, offers more flexibility by allowing users to apply it to any server of their choice. Some of you out there might see this and decide to run for the hills. Please don\u0026rsquo;t, and continue reading otherwise you will end up judging it too harshly.\nLicensing Explained # Introducing these licenses comes on the heels of the Immich team’s new full-time commitment to the project, thanks to their exciting partnership with FUTO.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s clear up a big question! Immich is still as free and open-source as it’s always been. These licenses are just a way to support the project, and skipping them won\u0026rsquo;t block any features or functionalities.\nSo as you can see the product is not as bad as you think. It\u0026rsquo;s an opt-in feature, not an opt out one. So please don\u0026rsquo;t be too negative on the devs.\nResponding to community feedback, they’ve revamped how you can purchase Immich. They also playfully named these updates “The-Words-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named.” The goal? To make buying options and licensing clearer and more user-friendly.\nFor instance, a shiny new “Buy” button will appear once your account hits the 14-day mark. And don\u0026rsquo;t worry, they included options to hide this button temporarily or forever, because who doesn’t love a good disappearing act?\nMore New Features # But wait, there’s more! Immich 1.110 isn\u0026rsquo;t just about the new licensing options. It also packs some nifty technical upgrades. Ever had trouble with thumbnails for iOS18 HEIC files or motion photos on your Pixel 6, 7, or 8? Problem solved!\nAnd to make things even easier, we’ve rolled out the “My Immich” URL forwarder. This handy tool saves your instance URL on your first visit and makes navigating your server-specific settings a breeze. It’s like having a personal assistant for your photo and video backups, minus the coffee runs.\nMap Tiles Say goodbye to third-party providers! Immich now proudly hosts its very own Map Tiles. This change brings a performance boost and less reliance on external services, making your map navigation faster and smoother, whether you\u0026rsquo;re in light or dark mode.\nSupporter Recognition To show some love to our financial backers, Immich has rolled out a product key-claiming mechanism on a dedicated website. Plus, you can now sport a shiny new supporter badge on your profile. Not a fan of badges? You can hide it if you prefer a more low-key look.\nEnhanced Security with TLS Client Certificates In Immich 1.110, security gets a boost! You can now add custom TLS certificates to the mobile app, perfect for those with specific network configurations. It’s like putting your app in a high-tech security bubble.\nMachine Learning and More This update isn’t just about looks and security. We’ve ramped up our machine learning game, especially with ARM-NN and OpenVINO support. This means better compatibility and faster performance across a variety of hardware. It’s like giving your devices a brain upgrade!\nWrapping up # There you have it folks. We shouldn\u0026rsquo;t judge a book by its cover as the saying goes. In this case we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t hate on a project as big as Immich when they clearly show that they care about the FOSS community listening to us. I hope you have enjoyed this post. As usual find a link to their git below.\nimmich-app/immich High performance self-hosted photo and video management solution.

Are you like me, and prefer to replace SteamOS with Batocera transforming your Deck into a Retro Gaming powerhouse ? Then this guide is for you\u0026hellip;\nBatocera # Batocera is an open-source and completely free retro-gaming distribution that can be copied to a USB stick or an SD card with the aim of turning any computer/nano computer into a gaming console during a game or permanently. Batocera.linux does not require any modification on your computer. Note that you must own the games you play in order to comply with the law.\nbatocera-linux/batocera.linux batocera.linux Python 1844 472 A few notes before we begin # In case you disagree with the idea behind this guide, and prefer to Dual-Boot SteamOS with Batocera for whatever reason, fear not I have written a guide covering just that. Find it below.\nBatocera On Deck - Part 1 15 July 2024\u0026middot;7 mins\u0026middot; loading \u0026middot; loading Batocera Emulation Retro Gaming Steam Deck Deck SteamDeck Linux Also this guide requires a bit of Linux knowledge. Since that method is considered less than ideal by many. The Deck was not made to be used that way so to speak. It\u0026rsquo;s more of a hack than an official thing.\nUser Caution. Tackle this Only if you know what you are doing, do it AT YOUR OWN RISK. This is a destructive guide, which will wipe any traces of SteamOS\u0026hellip; The reason why # I for one never cared about playing Triple-A games on that thing. Maybe indie games yes, reason being, I never saw any advantage of going from high FPS to extremely low just to justify my purchase. In my eyes the Deck has always been a monster Emulation Machine, no more no less. That\u0026rsquo;s where am gonna leave it. Say what you will, it\u0026rsquo;s my Deck, so I can do with it as I please. Freedom\u0026hellip;\nNow on with the guide eh ?\nWhat You Need: # Below is a list of things you will need before we proceed. I would recommend 2 cards, one you will be using and another as a backup, just in case something goes wrong.\nLinux Mint Debian Edition ISO. MicroSD Card: A fast U3 A2 card for ROM storage. Batocera Image: The image we will be using. Balena Etcher: Tool for flashing the image onto the microSD card Steam Deck: Your ultimate gaming device. Deck Dock for easy navigation via Keyboard \u0026amp; mouse. Step-by-Step Guide # 1. Download LMDE:\nFirst things first, head over to the Linix Mint and grab the latest Linux Mint Debian Edition ISO. This is the Distro we will be using temporarily in order to Flash Batocera on Deck\u0026rsquo;s internal storage. It\u0026rsquo;s the only one I had on hand that actually worked, surprising isn\u0026rsquo;t it ?\nBooting LMDE\nPut it on your Ventoy USB, or flash it on USB stick with Balena Etcher choice is yours. Once done, power down the Deck, plug the stick in and boot it while holding the Volume up + Power, release power keep holding volume up until you are on the bios screen. Then select Boot Manager then choose to boot from the stick you created. This will boot into LMDE and get you on the desktop.\nConnecting to WiFi\nI would recommend you be connected over ethernet via Dongle/Hub if you can, but if you can\u0026rsquo;t, it\u0026rsquo;s Ok, I will show you how to connect to WiFi.\nUsing your mouse n keyboard, click on the WiFi icon in the system tray, select your connection and enter you password. That\u0026rsquo;s it. If you do not have a dongle or hub then it will be more difficult since LMDE was not created with the Deck in mind.\nYou would have to go into Settings \u0026gt; Accessibility \u0026gt; Keyboard and enable it from there. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you really. That\u0026rsquo;s why I would highly recommend you have a Hub/Dongle/Dock handy.\n2. Download Batocera:\nNow, head over to the Batocera Site and grab the latest image for the Steam Deck. Make sure you select the correct image for your Steam Deck’s architecture – this is crucial to avoid any hiccups later on.\n3. Install Balena Etcher:\nNext up, we need Balena Etcher. This handy tool will flash the Batocera image onto your microSD card. Download it from Balena\u0026rsquo;s Site, install it on your Steam Deck, and fire it up. It’s super user-friendly, so no need to sweat this part.\n4. Flash Batocera to Internal Storage:\nOpen Balena Etcher, select the Batocera image file you just downloaded, and select the Deck\u0026rsquo;s SSD as the target. Hit the “Flash!” button and watch the magic happen. This process This should be done quick since image is only 3GB in size and you are flashing to a speedy SSD.\n5. Booting into Batocera:\nOnce the flashing is done, power down the Deck and remove the USB. Now, power on the Deck and voila! You’re booting into Batocera. Welcome to the retro world!\n6. First Time Setup:\nWhen you boot into Batocera for the first time, there are a few housekeeping items to handle:\nConnect to WiFi: Press the Start button, navigate to Network Settings, and enable WiFi. Select your network and enter the password. You’re online and ready to go! Configure Controllers: Most controllers are supported right out of the box. Connect via USB or Bluetooth, then head to Controller Settings to map buttons if needed. Easy peasy. System Language: If you prefer a language other than English, go to System Settings and change the language. Now you can navigate in your language of choice. 7. Adding Your Games:\nThis is where the fun begins. You need to add your game ROMs/Bios Files:\nFor security reasons, and to avoid this post from being flagged, I will not be showing where to get any of them from. That\u0026rsquo;s up to you.\nConnect your Steam Deck to a PC or use the built-in file manager. Transfer your game ROMs to the “share/roms” directory on the Deck. Transfer your Bios files too for any 3D/Disc based consoles. Although you can put your ROMs on the Deck\u0026rsquo;s internal SSD, do that only if you have either have enough storage (1tb or more) or as I said earlier, in case you don\u0026rsquo;t, then in Batocera\u0026rsquo;s menu, set the game storage to external and select microSD card (1tb recommended). Especially if you are like me and currently own complete ROM Sets, which can get HUGE ! I mean my PS1 RomSet alone is 600GB.. LoL.\nIf you want to do it over WiFi, just use your Distro\u0026rsquo;s file manager, in the address bar head on over to the device\u0026rsquo;s IP adderess that you can get from Network Settings.\nLike so, smb://ipaddress. Keep in mind you will need a functional installation of SAMBA for your distro. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know how, I guess it\u0026rsquo;s time to use the power of Google lol.\nIn short, would be easier to have ROMs on a microSD card than internal storage, simply because you can just plug it into your PC/Laptop n do the transfer that way. Over WiFI would be slow and unreliable. Same with ethernet.\n8. Customizing Batocera:\nNow, let’s make Batocera your own:\nThemes: Go to the UI Settings to change themes and give Batocera a fresh look. There are plenty to choose from, so find one that screams “you.” Shaders: Enhance your gaming experience with graphical shaders. Find them in the Video Settings. They can make your games look even better than you remember. Emulator Settings: Tweak individual emulator settings for optimal performance. This can make a huge difference in how smoothly your games run. Wrapping It Up # Before Batocera, my Steam Deck felt like a reliable but joyless workhorse. Installing Batocera changed everything. It transformed my Deck into a retro gaming paradise, making it feel more like the fun, nostalgic handhelds I love. With the retro magic of Batocera, my appreciation for the Deck skyrocketed.\nIn short, Batocera brings the joy of retro gaming front and center, making everything feel delightfully vintage and new all at once.\nEnjoy your retro gaming adventure on the Steam Deck! With this guide, you\u0026rsquo;re all set to dive into the golden age of gaming.

The lower crf, the higher the quality (range: 0-51). The default value is 23, and visually lossless compression corresponds to -crf 18.

Additional info \u0026raquo; Over Here\nffmpeg -i in.mp4 -preset slower -crf 18 out.mp4 Trimming # Without re-encoding:\nffmpeg -ss [start] -i in.mp4 -t [duration] -c copy out.mp4 -ss specifies the start time, e.g. 00:01:23.000 or 83 (in seconds) -t specifies the duration of the clip (same format). Recent ffmpeg also has a flag to supply the end time with -to. -c copy copies the first video, audio, and subtitle bitstream from the input to the output file without re-encoding them. This won\u0026rsquo;t harm the quality and make the command run within seconds. With re-encoding:\nIf you leave out the -c copy option, ffmpeg will automatically re-encode the output video and audio according to the format you chose. For high quality video and audio, read the x264 Encoding Guide and the AAC Encoding Guide, respectively.\nFor example:\nffmpeg -ss [start] -i in.mp4 -t [duration] -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental -b:a 128k out.mp4 Mux video and audio from another video # To copy the video from in0.mp4 and audio from in1.mp4:\nffmpeg -i in0.mp4 -i in1.mp4 -c copy -map 0:0 -map 1:1 -shortest out.mp4 With -c copy the streams will be stream copied, not re-encoded, so there will be no quality loss. If you want to re-encode, see FFmpeg Wiki: H.264 Encoding Guide. The -shortest option will cause the output duration to match the duration of the shortest input stream. See the -map option documentation for more info.

Recently @DistroTube made a video about an extension that most of you out there might like, so I thought, why not post about it here\u0026hellip;\nTiling Shell Information # This is a Gnome Shell extension implementing modern windows tiling system by extending GNOME\u0026rsquo;s default 2 columns to any layout you want! Can be installed on Gnome Shells from 40 to 46 on X11 and Wayland: the most recent GNOME Shell is supported, and older releases will include all the features and bug fixes!\n🤩 First and only extension that provides Windows 11\u0026rsquo;s snap assistant 🖥️🖥️ multiple monitors support, even with different scaling factors! ⚙️ Manage, edit, create and delete layouts with a built-in editor 💡 Layouts are not strict, you can span multiple tiles if you want 🚀 Automatically sets the same UI of your GNOME theme, for a seamless integration! Tiling Shell Installation # Before I tell you how to grab it, let me caution you with this\u0026hellip;\nGrab it either from the Gnome Extenstions site or via the Extension Manager app Not the A.U.R or any repos. With that out of the way, I say this coz many have tried grabbing it from the AUR only to suffer maintainers lagging behind on updates. It\u0026rsquo;s better to get it straight from source rather than rely on a 3rd party maintainer (man in the middle).\nIf you are using the XeroLinux toolkit, I added an option that will install everything you need to start customizing your Gnome experience. Which includes the Extension Manager application, that can be found under the 4 : System Customization menu.\nxerolinux/xlapit-cli XeroLinux Arch Post Install Toolkit Package Source Code Shell 30 9 Now that you got the extension installed, here\u0026rsquo;s some usage tips.\nTiling Shell Usage # Tiling System When grabbing and moving a window, press CTRL key to show the tiling layout (you can choose another key from the preferences). When moving on a tile, it will highlight. Ungrab the window to place that window on the highlighted tile.\nThis extension and the tiling system also implements Windows PowerToys FancyZones!\nSnap Assistant When grabbing and moving a window, the snap assistant will be available on top of the screen. Move the window near it to activate the snap assistant. While still grabbing the window, move your mouse to the tile you are interested in. By stopping grabbing the window will be tiled to the selected tile!\nSelect a layout Click on Tiling Shell\u0026rsquo;s panel indicator and the available layouts will be shown. Select the one you prefer by clicking on it. That layout will be applied to every monitor in case you have more than one.\nSelect multiple tiles The layout is not strict. You can select multiple tiles too! Just hold ALT while using the tiling system (you can choose another key from the preferences).\nSplit a tile : LEFT CLICK Split a tile vertically : LEFT CLICK + CTRL Delete a tile : RIGHT CLICK Save, or open the menu : Click the tray icon Smart resize You can resize adjacent tiled windows together!\nIt can be enabled/disabled from the preferences\nTile using Keyboard Move window through the tiles using keyboard shortcuts (SUPER+←/↑/↓/→). They can be customized from the preferences!\nEdge Tiling You can tile a window by moving it to the edge.\nWrapping up # That covers the basics. Now I just copy pasted from project Git, where you will find much more info, and can report issues should you encounter any. Here, I linked it below..\ndomferr/tilingshell Extend Gnome Shell with advanced tiling window management. Supports multiple monitors, Windows 11 Snap Assistant, Fancy Zones, customised tiling layouts and more. TypeScript 278 4 Even though I do not like or use Window Tiling myself, I think the developer behind this extension was heavily inspired by Windows\u0026rsquo; PowerToys Fancy Zones. I do not find this wrong in the slightest, on the contrary, it\u0026rsquo;s one of Windows\u0026rsquo; best features IMO. It\u0026rsquo;s nice to see it make its way to Linux.\nWith Windows constantly shooting itself in the foot, it\u0026rsquo;s fun to see its most useful parts being cherry picked and ported to Linux. Windows\u0026rsquo; loss is Liinux\u0026rsquo;s gain lol. Well, I hope you enjoy this neat little extension\u0026hellip;\nHonorable mention # As a bonus, I would like to mention another Tiling extension. But before I mention which, I want you to keep in mind that sometimes this extension, like many others tends to lag behind major Gnome releases, so for example when Gnome 47 lands, you will have to disable it and wait a while before it\u0026rsquo;s updated adding in support.\nNow, with TilingShell covering newcomers from Windows, the extension am talking about here, is none other than Forge, specifically targeted to those coming from a Tiling Window Manager, who prefer that way of doing things.\nTo install it use the aforementioned Extension Manager app. For more information about its features and how to use it, link to project\u0026rsquo;s Git found below.

Ready to turn your Steam Deck into a time machine for classic games? That\u0026rsquo;s where this guide comes in!\nBatocera # Batocera is an open-source and completely free retro-gaming distribution that can be copied to a USB stick or an SD card with the aim of turning any computer/nano computer into a gaming console during a game or permanently. Batocera.linux does not require any modification on your computer. Note that you must own the games you play in order to comply with the law.\nbatocera-linux/batocera.linux batocera.linux Python 1844 472 Background # Let me start by answering this question, before you ask it. \u0026ldquo;What do you mean by Part 1?\u0026rdquo;. Simple, this guide will be your normal run of the mill about installing Batocera on an SD-Card dual booting it with SteamOS.\n\u0026ldquo;What will you cover in Part 2?\u0026rdquo;. Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the moment where you will be rolling your eyes, while you call me a weirdo. Part 2 will cover how to wipe SteamOS replacing it with Batocera on the Deck\u0026rsquo;s internal SSD.\nThe reason why # I for one never cared about playing Triple-A games on that thing. Maybe indie games yes, reason being, I never saw any advantage of going from high FPS to extremely low just to justify my purchase. In my eyes the Deck has always been a monster Emulation Machine, no more no less. That\u0026rsquo;s where am gonna leave it. Say what you will, it\u0026rsquo;s my Deck, so I can do with it as I please. Freedom\u0026hellip;\nNow on with the guide eh ?\nWhy Batocera ? # Because who doesn’t love a good nostalgia trip? Batocera lets you play retro games on your Steam Deck without messing with your Steam library. It runs off a microSD card, so you can keep your games separate and swap systems effortlessly.\nWhat You Need: # Below is a list of things you will need before we proceed. I would recommend 2 cards, one you will be using and another as a backup, just in case something goes wrong.\nMicroSD Card: A fast U3 A2 card for smooth gameplay. Batocera Image: The image we will be using. Balena Etcher: Tool for flashing the image onto the microSD card Steam Deck: Your ultimate gaming device. Step-by-Step Guide # 1. Download Batocera:\nFirst things first, head over to the Batocera Site and grab the latest image for the Steam Deck. Make sure you select the correct image for your Steam Deck’s architecture – this is crucial to avoid any hiccups later on.\n2. Install Balena Etcher:\nNext up, we need Balena Etcher. This handy tool will flash the Batocera image onto your microSD card. Download it from Balena\u0026rsquo;s Site, install it on your Steam Deck, and fire it up. It’s super user-friendly, so no need to sweat this part.\n3. Flash Batocera to the microSD Card:\nInsert your microSD card into the Steam Deck or use an external card reader if you have one. Open Balena Etcher, select the Batocera image file you just downloaded, and choose your microSD card as the target. Hit the “Flash!” button and watch the magic happen. This process might take a few minutes, so maybe grab a coffee or do a quick victory dance.\n4. Booting into Batocera:\nOnce the flashing is done, insert the microSD card into your Steam Deck. Now, power on the Deck while holding the volume down button to enter the boot menu. Select the microSD card from the boot options, and voila! You’re booting into Batocera. Welcome to the retro world!\n5. First Time Setup:\nWhen you boot into Batocera for the first time, there are a few housekeeping items to handle:\nConnect to WiFi: Press the Start button, navigate to Network Settings, and enable WiFi. Select your network and enter the password. You’re online and ready to go! Configure Controllers: Most controllers are supported right out of the box. Connect via USB or Bluetooth, then head to Controller Settings to map buttons if needed. Easy peasy. System Language: If you prefer a language other than English, go to System Settings and change the language. Now you can navigate in your language of choice. 6. Adding Your Games:\nThis is where the fun begins. You need to add your game ROMs:\nConnect your Steam Deck to a PC or use the built-in file manager. Transfer your game ROMs to the “share/roms” directory on the microSD card. You can organize them by creating subfolders for each console. Batocera will automatically detect and list your games. It’s like magic! 7. Customizing Batocera:\nNow, let’s make Batocera your own:\nThemes: Go to the UI Settings to change themes and give Batocera a fresh look. There are plenty to choose from, so find one that screams “you.” Shaders: Enhance your gaming experience with graphical shaders. Find them in the Video Settings. They can make your games look even better than you remember. Emulator Settings: Tweak individual emulator settings for optimal performance. This can make a huge difference in how smoothly your games run. A Proper Boot Menu # After the initial setup, you might find it annoying to hold down the volume key during boot up. We can make this experience much smoother with a boot menu called Clover.\nInstalling Clover:\nEnsure the Batocera microSD card is in place. Boot into SteamOS and access the Steam desktop. Connect to WiFi if you’re not already connected. Open the Konsole terminal and type the following commands: cd ~/ git clone https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot cd ~/SteamDeck-Clover-dualboot chmod +x install-Clover.sh ./install-Clover.sh If prompted to set a sudo password, do so and rerun the script with ./install-Clover.sh. The script will ask for your sudo password and let you choose the default OS (SteamOS is recommended). The script will run automatically, setting up Clover. Once done, you’ll see a boot menu every time you start your Steam Deck, allowing you to select your desired environment. Troubleshooting Tips # Running into issues? Here are some quick fixes:\nBatocera Not Booting: Double-check that the image was flashed correctly and the microSD card is properly inserted. Sometimes it’s the simple things. Controller Issues: Make sure your controllers are fully charged and properly paired. If needed, re-map the buttons in Controller Settings. Network Problems: Restart your router or double-check your WiFi settings. Sometimes technology just needs a little nudge. Slow Performance: Consider using a faster microSD card or tweaking emulator settings for better performance. Bonus Tips: # Backup microSD: Keep a second card with a fresh Batocera image just in case. You never know when you might need it. Explore Settings: Batocera is packed with customization options. Take some time to explore and tweak settings to your liking. BIOS Files: Some games may require BIOS files. Ensure these are placed in the correct directories for each console. Enjoy your retro gaming adventure on the Steam Deck! With this guide, you\u0026rsquo;re all set to dive into the golden age of gaming. Happy gaming!\nWrapping It Up # Before Batocera, my Steam Deck felt like a reliable but joyless workhorse. Installing Batocera changed everything. It transformed my Deck into a retro gaming paradise, making it feel more like the fun, nostalgic handhelds I love. With the retro magic of Batocera and a proper boot menu, my appreciation for the Deck skyrocketed.\nIn short, Batocera brings the joy of retro gaming front and center, making everything feel delightfully vintage and new all at once.\nIf you are looking for a much more detailed guide, might I recommend checking either Wagner\u0026rsquo;s Tech Talk or Retro Handhelds where I sourced most my material from.\nSee you in Part 2, in a couple of weeks when my Steam Deck is back with me, and have tested my methods before bringing you the guide, just so I am as accurate as possible\u0026hellip;.\n","date":"15 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/bato-deck/","section":"FOSS Posts","summary":"Hey there, retro gamer!

To which I would like to reespond with, what\u0026rsquo;s wrong with that ? I mean, why do you find it so strange for one to use what one likes if it works for them and stick with it ? I like what I like, never had any strange and deal breaking issues that affected my day to day.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not to say that issues do not exist, oh they do. But, in my case, for my specific usage, none of them were severe enough to cause me to move away. Annoying, yes, but not deal breaking. I did try many other DEs, like Gnome, XFCE, Cinnamon, even Hyprland, none of which worked for me. I found myself having to force myself to adapt to them, while with KDE Plasma not so much, it reflects my personality.\nI also tried many other Distros, like Fedora and many of its spins, Debian Sid, OpenSuse, uBlue Aurora, all with Plasma, none of which I could adapt to. Arch just works for me, it\u0026rsquo;s super easy to fix when issues do happen.\nOh, I forgot to mention that I am not much of a gamer, so there\u0026rsquo;s that too. If I do play games I have never experienced 120fps or higher, am used 60fps, so am fine with that. My current hardware cannot do any better anyway\u0026hellip;\nJust wanted to cover these facts before moving on with the Hardware \u0026amp; Software I use\u0026hellip;\nThe Software # Linux Distro : I love working with ArchLinux in all its forms. It\u0026rsquo;s the most flexible Distro I have ever had the pleasure to work with. Allowing me to build things from the ground up without it being too complex, or getting in my way. That\u0026rsquo;s why all my systems run it or one of its spins.\nTo summarize, I use Vanilla Arch on main rig, XeroLinux on HomeLab and Manjaro on HTPC. As you can see Arch is at the core of every OS I use.\nDesktop Environment : As for the Desktop Environment I love working with, it\u0026rsquo;s none other than KDE Plasma, simply because it\u0026rsquo;s so damn beautiful, and easy to work with. And since I am more of a visual old geezer, it fits my needs so well it ain\u0026rsquo;t a joke. That\u0026rsquo;s why I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself using anything else for a long time to come.\nNote :\nI do dabble with other Non-Arch Distros and other DEs from time to time to keep my knowledge fresh, and to post about them on this here site.\nThe Hardware # I do own many, 3 Desktops and 1 Laptop. Main, Home-Lab \u0026amp; HTPC. Laptop is unimportant just runs my shop.\nThe Beast :\nMain rig, the one I do all my Development, Gaming and other things on, which I label as StationXero.\nI know the GTX 1080 is an aging GPU, trust me I am trying to raise money to replace it with at least an RTX 3080/3090. I could use better Wayland support. Am not really a gamer though, so that part I do not perticularly care about.\nGPU \u0026amp;/or CPU Upgrade Fund. More info \u0026raquo; Here Home-Lab :\nAnother desktop I call XeroLab, as the name implies, is my Home-Lab PC, it runs all my Docker Containers. It has 32GB RAM with a Core i7 6800K and an old P.O.S GT-710 GPU that I will be replacing as soon as I can raise the money for one.\nThat thing has survived many failed nvidia-470xx driver updates, but I finally decided with how old GPU is to stick with nouveau open source drivers.\nThe HTPC :\nFinally there\u0026rsquo;s my HTPC, which has the same CPU as XeroLab, with a few differences, being the GPU which is a GTX 650 Ti-Boost OC, and the 16GB RAM. Now whith it being my HTPC, it has 14 Drives of various sizes totalling ~68TB of storage.\nThe only app installed on that thing is Plex Server as a Snap.\nSince I need Hardware Acceleration so I am able to encode \u0026amp; decode the movies \u0026amp; TV-Shows I watch, I have no choice but to use the Distro provided nVidia-470xx proprietary ones. So far so good, no issues.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it folks. Now you have a better idea of what equipment I use on a daily basis to bring you everything I do. I did not list all the softwares I use coz it\u0026rsquo;s a long list that varies a lot.

Linux now post\u0026hellip;\nSome Information # Zed is a high-performance, open-source code editor built using the Rust programming language. Here are the key points about Zed:\nBuilt with Rust: Zed is written entirely in Rust, a systems programming language known for its speed, safety, and concurrency features. This allows Zed to offer superior performance compared to many other code editors. Fast and Responsive: Zed\u0026rsquo;s innovative GPU-based user interface (GPUI) framework allows it to efficiently leverage the GPU to provide an incredibly fast and responsive coding experience, with instant file loading and smooth UI updates. Collaborative Coding: Zed supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously from different locations. Customizable: Zed provides a range of customization options, including themes, plugins, and adjustable settings, allowing developers to tailor the editor to their specific needs and workflows. Open-Source: Zed was open-sourced in 2024 and is available under the MIT license, allowing developers to contribute to its development and extend its functionality. Cross-Platform: Zed is currently available for macOS, with plans for Linux support in the future. Windows support is not yet available. In summary, Zed is a modern, high-performance code editor built using the Rust programming language, offering developers a fast, collaborative, and customizable coding experience. Its open-source nature and focus on performance and productivity make it an exciting new option in the code editor landscape.\nExtension Support # Zed\u0026rsquo;s extension support is a key aspect of its customizability and flexibility as a code editor. While Zed is built on a robust core, its true power lies in the ability to extend its functionality through a vibrant ecosystem of plugins and extensions.\nDevelopers can tap into a growing library of community-contributed extensions that add support for a wide range of programming languages, integrate with popular tools and services, and enhance the overall coding experience. From syntax highlighting and code formatting to advanced debugging and deployment workflows, Zed\u0026rsquo;s extension system allows users to tailor the editor to their specific needs.\nThe extension system is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a straightforward process for discovering, installing, and managing extensions directly within the Zed interface. This empowers developers to quickly find and implement the tools and features they require, without the need for complex configuration or external setup.\nAs Zed continues to gain traction and attract a dedicated user base, the extension ecosystem is expected to flourish, with more and more developers contributing their own custom extensions and integrations. This extensibility is a key factor that sets Zed apart, allowing it to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of modern software development.\nAssistant integrations # Zed\u0026rsquo;s assistant integration is a key feature that allows developers to seamlessly collaborate with AI language models within the code editor. Here are the main points about Zed\u0026rsquo;s assistant capabilities:\nConversational Interface: Zed provides a dedicated assistant editor panel that functions similar to a chat interface. Users can type prompts and queries, and the assistant\u0026rsquo;s responses are displayed in real-time below. Multiple Roles: The assistant editor supports different message blocks for the \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Assistant\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;System\u0026rdquo; roles, allowing for structured conversations and context management. Customizable Models: Zed allows users to select the AI model they want to use, including options like OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s GPT models and Anthropic\u0026rsquo;s Claude. Users can also specify custom API endpoints for the models. Code Interaction: The assistant can interact with code snippets, with users able to easily insert code from the editor into the conversation and have the assistant provide feedback or generate new code. Prompt Library: Zed includes a prompt library feature that allows users to save and reuse custom prompts to guide the assistant\u0026rsquo;s responses, including a \u0026ldquo;default prompt\u0026rdquo; that sets the initial context. Streaming Responses: Responses from the assistant are streamed in real-time, and users can cancel the stream at any point if the response is not what they were expecting. Overall, Zed\u0026rsquo;s assistant integration provides a seamless way for developers to leverage the capabilities of large language models directly within their coding workflow, enhancing productivity and collaboration.\nInstalling \u0026amp; configuring Zed # It\u0026rsquo;s available on the Arch Extra Repos, you can easily install it from there via :\nsudo pacman -S --needed zed Configure Zed Use ⌘ + , to open your custom settings to set things like fonts, formatting settings, per-language settings, and more. You can access the default configuration using the Zed \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Open Default Settings menu item. See Configuring Zed for all available settings.\nSet up your key bindings You can access the default key binding set using the Zed \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Open Default Key Bindings menu item. Use ⌘ + K, ⌘ + S to open your custom keymap to add your key bindings. See Key Bindings for more info.\nTo all you Vim users out there visit the =\u0026gt; Vim Docs.\n⌘ =\u0026gt; Super Key\nWhat I think of it # I love this thing. It\u0026rsquo;s slowly replacing my current IDE Kate. It\u0026rsquo;s more flexible, cutomizable and most importantly it\u0026rsquo;s got GPU Acceleration where Kate doesn\u0026rsquo;t, at least not as well. Oh it\u0026rsquo;s also super lightweight.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s not as the video says, a 1:1 VSCode replacement, with some lacking features, it\u0026rsquo;s getting there. It\u0026rsquo;s relatively new, so I only see good things in its future, it just needs time to cook.\nHowever, it already includes support for the main plugins I, myself care about, like Git, Docker Compose, Toml, Yaml, Make, Java, Bash, Markdown among others, with more in the pipeline\u0026hellip;This post was written using it BTW\u0026hellip;\nAnd if you know me by now I love its theme engine, with the likes of Dracula, Catppuccin, Nord, Synthwave \u0026lsquo;84 among others already available to install.. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the main things that attracted me to it lol. Nothing else to say about it except that I highly recommend you give it a try.\nIt has way more than what I mentioned here, so if you want to know more about it, either go to the \u0026raquo; Docs/Wiki page, or visit their Git Repo below.\nzed-industries/zed Code at the speed of thought – Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter.

But before we do that, unlike video, we are not going to create a custom config, you are free to do so, will link you to the project Git at the end of this post where you can follow a more in-depth tutorial.

Without whom it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have lasted as long as it did. As well as the rest of the projects present and future.\nClarification :\nIntention of the PlasmaInstall script was not to replace ArchInstall but to fix its Plasma profile while extending it further nothing more. If you want Gnome, XFCE or any other DE/WM for that matter, existing profiles are fine. The only other one that is messed up is the Hyprland one but alas since I don\u0026rsquo;t use it I have no idea how to fix it. However, the Toolkit can be used on any DE or WM it\u0026rsquo;s agnostic.\nNow, this guide complements the above video, they are to be used together, I will try not to ramble on too much. Some of you have asked the question, \u0026ldquo;is the Distro really gone ?\u0026rdquo; I would like to say, no, not really. Let me explain a bit before going ahead with written guide. Since it was nothing but ArchLinux + Customized/riced KDE Plasma nothing more, one could achieve the same result by using my Plasma Install script.\nYeah we can easily get XeroLinux back in all its glory, it\u0026rsquo;s just no longer an ISO with Calamares. It\u0026rsquo;s still easy to install thanks in part to the infamous ArchInstall script then my own. So all is not lost.\nIn this super detailed guide I will be showing off how it can be done.\nWhat we need # Let\u0026rsquo;s start off by knowing what we need to get started. First off, we will need the latest version of the \u0026raquo; ArchLinux ISO, a USB stick to burn ISO onto, we can either use \u0026raquo; Balena Etcher or the highly recommended \u0026raquo; Ventoy linked below.\nVentoy - Best multi-boot tool 27 June 2024\u0026middot;3 mins\u0026middot; loading \u0026middot; loading Ventoy Usb-Boot Multi-Boot Distro-Hopping Linux Opensource Those are the essentials. As to my Plasma Install script will get to that a bit later down the line. Once we got everything, we shall begin\u0026hellip;\nPart 1 - Installing ArchLinux # Ok, so now that we have burned the ISO to the USB using either tools, boot the system we want to install it on using it. Am not gonna go through showing you how, you should know that by now lol.\nNote :\nThis guide expects you to be connected to the internet via ethernet. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t and need to connect over WiFi, you can follow guide on the ArchWiki\nRemote Install via SSH Now, unlike other guides out there, I will be showing how we can use SSH to do the installation remotely, which will make things much easier. All we need is a secondary PC running Linux. If none is available, this part can be skipped.\nOk, first things first, we need to set a password to the root user. We do it by typing the following command in the TTY, like this :\npasswd Now we type our temporary password \u0026amp; confirm it. Once that\u0026rsquo;s done, we need to get the machine\u0026rsquo;s IP Address, we do that by running this command :\nip a Once we have it, all we need to do to connect to the machine is the following command :\nssh root@ipaddress We confirm by typing yes. That\u0026rsquo;s it, now we are connected to the machine remotely, so we can now easily copy paste comands for a much simpler install\u0026hellip;\nArchInstall Script Once connected, first thing we will have to do is, make sure we have latest version of ArchInstall. We do that by running the following command :\npacman -Syy archinstall \u0026amp;\u0026amp; archinstall --advanced Now some of you might be asking me, \u0026ldquo;why the --advanced flag ?\u0026rdquo;, to which I answer, simply because devs still hide the parallel downloads behind it for whatever reason. It\u0026rsquo;s fine at least now you know.\nOk, now that we have the installer running, am not going to go through each and every option one by one, just the important ones. Those are explained in the video. Am also not gonna bother with manual partitioning since the guide is intended for single OS easy install.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why we will be using the Best Guess option, carefully selecting the correct drive we want install ArchLinux onto.\nI will not be held responsible for any data loss resulting from selection of the wrong drive. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE. Anyway, let\u0026rsquo;s make sure we skip the parts I mentioned in the video, since everything will now be done Post-Install via my Toolkit. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to set parallel downloads to as many as you like for faster downloads. Also as mentioned, we do not need to enable any extra repos like multilib since my script will do that for us later on.\nNow once everything is configured and set, hit install, sit back, grab a cup of Tea/Coffee and watch it do its thing. Might take a while it all depends on Internet connection\u0026hellip;\nPart 2 - Installing Plasma # Once that\u0026rsquo;s all done, we will be prompted if we want to chroot into our new install, we answer with yes of course since we still have no DE yet.\nUser Caution. We do not recommend to blindly execute scripts without inspecting them first. To download and inspect script, use the following command, open it in your IDE of choice and inspect it. Only run it when you trust the code.\nwget https://tinyurl.com/PlasmaInstall Once you trust it, you can move on. Now, depending on the method that was used, ssh or not, we either copy paste the command below or type it manually :\nbash -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/PlasmaInstall)\u0026#34; This will execute the script. Just go through the prompts. I would Highly recommend option 3) Xero\u0026rsquo;s Curated Set Of Plasma Packages to avoind any future headaches. I went through all groups with a fine tooth comb as the saying goes making sure we get the best experience. But that\u0026rsquo;s not to say we cannot select any of the other options, it\u0026rsquo;s all up to you in the end.\nAt the end, script will prompt us if we want to enable the XeroLinux Repo and install the Toolkit, to which we answer with yes, since we will be using it to set everything up later on.\nYou will notice that, the multilib repo was enabled as well. I made sure of that since most newcomers forget to do it. It\u0026rsquo;s an essential repo required for the likes of Steam, and various drivers.\nFinally, for now at least, once script is done, we will be prompted to exit and reboot the system. We do that by typing exit then reboot, and that\u0026rsquo;s it for this part anyway\u0026hellip;\nPart 3 - Setting up the system # If all went smoothly, we should now be greeted with SDDM, KDE\u0026rsquo;s login page. I would recommend Plasma X11 over Wayland, at least for now. Yes, my script still includes X11 for compatibility. I will not get rid of it any time soon, at least not until I feel that more apps are ready for Wayland.\nOnce logged in, there are a few things we need to take care of first. Open Terminal, as shown in video, and update the system\nsudo pacman -Syyu Then we launch the XeroLinux Post Installation Toolkit from the AppMenu, under System. That\u0026rsquo;s what we will be using from here on in.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s up to you to discover all the options, that\u0026rsquo;s why I did not mention them all in video, nor will I here. The whole point of this guide is how to get XeroLinux back not to set up the system from A to Z.\n1 : System Setup There\u0026rsquo;s nothing to do here except select Install 3rd-Party GUI Package Manager(s) or Add \u0026amp; Enable the ChaoticAUR Repository, since my Plasma Script took care of the rest for us. Neat eh ?\nNote :\nI would highly recommend you enable the Chaotic AUR repo, if you install a lot of packages from the AUR, to avoid having to compile them.\n2 : System Drivers This is the part where you select drivers you need for our hardware. Am not going to help you here. All you need to know was mentioned in the video. Just know that selecting the wrong ones will break the system, so that\u0026rsquo;s where you need to understand what works for you.\n4 : System Customization Now we jump to Customization section. Just select option x. XeroLinux\u0026rsquo;s Layan Plasma 6 Rice, enter your sudo password, and watch it do its thing.. Once it\u0026rsquo;s done, we will be prompted to reboot. Use the AppMenu to do that..\nNote :\nIf you have selected to enable the Chaotic AUR repos, install will go fast. If not it will take a bit, while it compiles some packages from the AUR.\nFinal words # That\u0026rsquo;s it boys n girls. We just got XeroLinux back ! The rest is up to you. Go through the toolkit see if you find anything useful. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to contact me on either Fosstodon or Discord, or even in the video comments section.\nI will do my best to answer. Keep in mind that I might not have all the answers, simply because I only have the hardware I have, might be different than yours, so can\u0026rsquo;t know what works on something I do not own. Though I am and always will open to suggestions\u0026hellip;\nxerolinux/xero-plasma The XeroLinux Plasma installer script Shell 3 1 Use the repo above to report any issues with PlasmaInstall, and I will get to them as soon as I can.

This Bash script is all about automation and ease, bringing you through the installation process with a slick TUI interface that’s both stylish and user-friendly.\nArch Linux is legendary for its flexibility and simplicity, but let’s face it, installing it can be a bit of a headache. That’s where Amelia comes in. This nifty tool mixes automation with interactivity, making the installation process a breeze without taking away any control from you, the user.\nFeatures # Clocking in at almost 6,000 lines of Bash brilliance, Amelia is designed for modern GPT systems. It uses the Discoverable Partitions Specification to automatically detect and manage partitions, saving you from the dreaded fstab editing. Seriously, who wants to manually edit fstab?\nAmelia is on the cutting edge with its approach to file systems and initialization. For instance, if you’re using ext4, it bypasses the old genfstab command and lets systemd handle the necessary setup. The same goes for initramfs – systemd takes over from the old base and udev combo, streamlining everything.\nBut don’t worry, control freaks! Amelia keeps you in the driver’s seat with interactive, menu-driven prompts that guide you through every step.\nDisk Management # For handling disks, Amelia uses cgdisk, which provides a pseudo-GUI that’s both powerful and easy to use. It makes partition management safe and straightforward.\nAmelia lets you make all the important decisions, asking for confirmation at each critical juncture. This ensures you’re always informed and in control, minimizing the risk of any unwanted surprises.\nWith a detailed menu system, you can personalize, configure your system, and manage disks with ease. Pick your locale, keyboard layout, and optimize your system for different desktop environments like KDE Plasma, GNOME, or Xfce.\nAdvanced users will appreciate options for kernel selection and EFI boot management. Before kicking off the installation, Amelia checks for UEFI mode, internet connectivity, and updates the system clock to keep everything in sync.\nFor the pros, Amelia offers features like LUKS encryption for disk partitions and customization of the pacstrap process. Depending on your level of expertise and preferences, you can choose between automatic or manual partitioning and installation modes.\nGetting Started with Amelia # Ready to dive in ? First, boot up from the Arch live ISO image. Once you see the shell prompt, download Amelia with this simple Curl command:\ncurl -O https://gitlab.com/prism7/archery/-/raw/main/Amelia.sh Make sure you’ve got a working internet connection. Then, fire up the script and follow the prompts:\nsh Amelia.sh When the installation wraps up, you’ll get a confirmation screen. Reboot your computer, and voila – your shiny new Arch Linux system is ready to roll.\nFinal Thoughts # Amelia is a powerhouse when it comes to installing Arch Linux. But let’s set expectations – this tool is geared towards experienced users, not beginners. Its main goal is to save time for those who already know their way around an Arch installation.\nIf you’re expecting a step-by-step hand-holding experience, you might be disappointed. A solid understanding of partition types and manual setup is still required, especially for disk partitioning.\nI managed to set up Arch with a KDE Plasma desktop in just 20 minutes, thanks to Amelia. However, there were a few hiccups. We ran into issues with missing Plasma packages, with unnecessary ones being installed.\nAnother thing we did not like so much that we feel that might push new users away is the fact that when we selected the regular Plasma profile, it offered a selective install for every group, which we feel might overwhelm users, especially ones who have no idea what each package does.\nOne cool feature, however, is that Amelia includes ViM/NeoViM that most Devs out there might appreciate.\nIn summary, Amelia is a fantastic tool for streamlining the Arch Linux installation process.

So sit back, grab a cup of tea/coffee and read on. It\u0026rsquo;s under this category coz it simply isn\u0026rsquo;t related to Linux.\nBack Story # I want to talk about project\u0026rsquo;s YouTube Channel. I know I talked about it a few times before, but this time it\u0026rsquo;s not personal. Far from it, it\u0026rsquo;s just to update everyone on the situation.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s begin with how it all started. As I was working on the now discontinued XeroLinux Distro, someone asked me if I could create a channel where I documented everything. At first I hesitated, due to the lack of knowledge there, and being camera shy, which am not anymore as you saw.\nFirst few videos did not have my face, but slowly I started to appear in a few until it became the norm. I kept experimenting with a few setups still did until today. Was never satisfied.\nI did not know what type of content to bring you guys, and getting monetization status was hard, until I met Alex from TheLinuxTube channel, who introduned me to someone who helped me get there and fast. But sadly, even with that status, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting enough views to profit from it.\nI get it, it\u0026rsquo;s not your fault, but it was more related to the type of content I was making, mostly related to ArchLinux and my project. I even attempted to to host a podcast, and interview well-known Content Creators, which I failed miserably.\nI did that for a while, then stopped. I came back for a while, thinking that\u0026rsquo;s it am on a roll now, with a video every Wednesday, and a Live at the end of every month. But alas, that did not work in my favor as much as I wanted it to\u0026hellip;\nPresent \u0026amp; Future # Which brings me to the present. You will no longer see any videos from me for now. That\u0026rsquo;s it, I do apologize for that. It\u0026rsquo;s also that creating videos has affected my mental health negatively for little gain and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to recover from that. Fear not though, channel isn\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere, I will be leaving it up, in case you find a video that helps you.\nAs for the future of the channel, well I do not know. Maybe one day, if and when I settle down, with a decent job that actually makes me money to grab the required equipment, take care of some lingering health/appearance issues, I might consider coming back.\nBlogging # As you might have noticed, lately I have been concentrating on written content. It brings me more joy, more freedom to express myself, and most importantly I get to share more tools and guides.\nThe only thing you will not see from me are Distro Reviews, Vs and Bechmarking posts. Why ? Well quite simply because I lack the tools, hardware for benchmarking, and prefer not to start dramas when it comes to Distro Reviews and Vs posts, because as I have noticed lately, the FOSS community tends to be strongly opinionated, and sees Favoritism where there is none. I will leave those kinds of posts to those who like to do them.\nAlso I think that written content tends to be more useful than videos, simply because in case of commands to be run, paths to be used etc, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to copy and paste rather than pause the video and type them manually. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say that videos are not useful, on the contrary, if it weren\u0026rsquo;t for them, posts would be stale and boring, that\u0026rsquo;s why in my humble opinion, they compliment written content, helping us include a showcase of the product we are talking about.\nAnyway, from now on, and for the foreseeable future I will be concentrating on what I love most, which is blogging. I have so much to share, so little time as the saying goes lol\u0026hellip;\nThe other blog # Oh, I forgot to mention the Other Blog, well, since am enjoying written content, I thought I would also start a personal Journal, where I document how I feel about different things in the land of FOSS and my projects.\nI keep it separate from this site, so as to not litter it with personal feelings as it were. That kind of content has no place here. I made it publicly available, so you can join me on my quest so to say. If you don\u0026rsquo;t care for that kind of content, by all means don\u0026rsquo;t go there. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of lows with a bit of highs.. Simply coz that\u0026rsquo;s how I feel right now. Hoping for more positivity in the near future- (knock on wood).\nClosing words # I know this might be a lot to take in. I just felt like sharing an update regarding the channel, and by extension the present and future state of affairs here at the XeroLinux HQ. I hope I did not bore you to death lol.\nAnywho, thanks for reading all this, looking forward to your thoughts on the matter over on Fosstodon.\nCheers !\n","date":"4 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/news/youtube-status/","section":"XeroLinux News","summary":"Today I bring you a different kind of post.

You can use one of the presupplied images like Bazzite (gaming-focused image), Bluefin (general use zero-manitenance image), Aurora or their base images with minimal customizations to vanilla kinoite/silverblue/etc.\nWhat is Aurora? # Before explaining it, I would like to answer the \u0026ldquo;Why Aurora ?\u0026rdquo; question, well in case you did not know it yet, I am a KDE Plasma shill, so why not Aurora ? LoL. Now on to what it is\u0026hellip;\nAurora is Bluefin but with another coat of paint, the KDE Desktop. Many people love and cherish GNOME, but others want the customizability or the looks of a vanilla KDE experience. For those people, Aurora is here to serve them that need!\nublue-os/bluefin The next generation Linux workstation, designed for reliability, performance, and sustainability. Shell 844 132 It includes everything that makes Bluefin and Bluefin-DX so awesome, including brew on host, the bluefin-cli, the starship CLI experience, Tailscale and the container-native Ptyxis terminal. You’ll find that most of the things you’re used to in Bluefin are the same under the hood, including the just commands. Aurora is not designed to be a drastically different experience than Bluefin, which also means we (I) can keep it regularly in sync with upstream so you get the latest changes.\nIt is built on the kinoite-main Images. The images feature almost no customization, aside from some quality of life features and some branding. You can expect a vanilla KDE experience with developer batteries under the hood.\nThe upsides / benefits # An Awesome Package Manager I will begin by saying this, it\u0026rsquo;s a neat project, I love how they use their sorta package manager called ujust that reminds me a heck of a lot of Topgrade which handles everything.\nTopgrade AiO Updater 26 June 2024\u0026middot;3 mins\u0026middot; loading \u0026middot; loading Update All-in-One TUI Terminal Tools Linux Pre-Bundled Scripts Not just that, but they also supply so many pre-configured scripts that make harder tasks on other distros so damn simple, it\u0026rsquo;s not even funny. They even supply an image with the nVidia or AMD drivers baked it and pre-configured for you so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to lift a finger.\nStability and Immunability Also, the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s so stable with truly almost zero-maintenance needed by you the user is a Huge benefit. Especially that it uses rpm-ostree. And that it\u0026rsquo;s immune to any mistakes you might make, is so awesome. If you break the system just reboot select an older snapshot and you are back up and running. However one can still break it, but you really have to try lol.\nThey even supply an image for us devs out there with all the tools we might need to be productive out the box. I mean wow, could there be any more handholding ?\nThe Downsides (No Dealbreakers) # Too Much Cruft ? Which brings me to the only Big downside, which is in my humble opinion, that it has way too much out the box, even the simple version. I get it, it aims to be as out of one\u0026rsquo;s way as possible letting us be more productive, while I agree with this, it tends to target a smaller audience. Coz not everyone wants or needs everything it provides. I mean we don\u0026rsquo;t even get to choose what we want out the box, ending up having to remove the cruft we do not need. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s more of a Fedora limitation I do not know.\nLaziness / No Self-Reliance Now this is much less of an issue, more of an obervation, but if I have learned something during my Distro Maintaining days, it\u0026rsquo;s that doing too much for the user out the box, will make them both lazy and will end up too dependent on us devs/maintainers. While I can\u0026rsquo;t speak for the team behind uBlue, it\u0026rsquo;s just impossible to satisfy everyone.\nNo Freedom To Tinker The other downside to this whole idea of Atomic distros, is that, if you were a tinkerer like me, who loves to mess with the system, modify core functionalities, you simply can\u0026rsquo;t. As such you will be heavily relying on Flatpaks. It\u0026rsquo;s not a big deal though, since this project wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be used that way, so am not gonna be docking it any points for that.\nWould I recommend it ? # In conclusion, I will say, this is my opinion, and that you should take it with a huge grain of salt. I am a tinkerer, a not so ordinary user so to speak. And I have only been using it a day as of the writing of this post.\nBut yes, of ourse I would Highly recommend you at least give it a try. Just make sure to select the version that works best for you. Be it AMD, nVidia, or the Dev/DX version.\nJust make sure you know that you will not be able to tinker much with it, the way you would be able to with the likes of Arch or the likes.\nAs for me, nope it will not replace my daily driver, ArchLinux, nothing will, I prefer my freedom for tinkering with the system. I was just curious as to what the deal was with all the Atomic distros out there is all.\nDownload Bluefin Aurora That’s it folks ..\nCheers !\n","date":"1 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/aurora-atomic/","section":"FOSS Posts","summary":"What is uBlue Atomic? # uBlue is a project which produces images based on Fedora Atomic distros.

So, enjoy what I\u0026rsquo;ve put together!\nIntroduction # Choosing the right GPU for your Linux system involves weighing several factors, especially considering the evolving landscape of drivers, performance benchmarks, and software compatibility. The debate between AMD Radeon and Nvidia RTX GPUs is one of the oldest in the tech community, akin to the timeless Android vs iOS debate. Here’s a general breakdown based on recent experiences with AMD Radeon and insights into Nvidia GPUs\nAMD Radeon : FOSS and Easy # Examining AMD GPUs on Linux reveals both their strengths and challenges. Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons.\nOpen-Source Drivers: AMD’s commitment to open-source drivers is a significant advantage for Linux users. Installation is straightforward, and compatibility with modern Linux distributions like Ubuntu and ArchLinux is generally robust. Gaming performance out of the box is commendable, with most titles running smoothly using these drivers. A quote from AMD\u0026rsquo;s Forrest Norod :\nWe are absolutely committed to open [ecosystems], even open to working with customers or others that are directly competing with us in the end. That is to everybody\u0026rsquo;s benefit, ourselves included.\nPrice Performance Ratio: One of the standout features of AMD GPUs is their competitive pricing relative to Nvidia. The RX 6700 XT, for example offers excellent value for money, often providing more VRAM at a lower cost compared to Nvidia’s equivalents.\nGaming Experience: For gaming enthusiasts, AMD GPUs shine brightly.

Although AMD’s ROCm platform is evolving, compatibility and performance may not yet match Nvidia’s offerings for AI and deep learning applications.\nMachine Learning \u0026amp; Encoding: Challenges arise when needing specific features like hardware video encoding (VAAPI) or compatibility with proprietary software such as DaVinci Resolve. Installing bleeding-edge Mesa libraries and kernels may be necessary for optimal performance, which can complicate the setup for less experienced users.\nOpenCL and ROCm Support: While AMD supports OpenCL, the ecosystem is still catching up to Nvidia’s CUDA dominance in fields like machine learning and professional video editing. Updates like ROCm 6.0.x show promise but may not yet fully match Nvidia’s capabilities in these specialized areas.\nNvidia RTX Series : Proprietary but Robust # Nvidia’s RTX GPUs offer a diverse range of advantages over AMD, but they also come with their own set of challenges. Now we are not gonna be mentioning older GTX and lower GPUs since those present even more limitations.\nCUDA and Proprietary Drivers: Nvidia’s proprietary drivers are highly esteemed for stability and performance on Linux, particularly in scientific computing, AI, and professional video editing where CUDA acceleration is indispensable. They generally integrate well with distributions like Ubuntu but may encounter occasional compatibility and stability issues, especially with newer kernel versions or specific configurations.\nEnhanced Stability with Version 555.x: Recent updates introduce Explicit Sync Explained support for Wayland users, merged a short while ago, enhancing stability and performance optimizations without additional configuration, although full support depends on the desktop environment like KDE Plasma or GNOME, not currently available for Hyprland.\nRay Tracing and DLSS: Nvidia RTX GPUs excel in real-time ray tracing and AI-enhanced features such as DLSS, delivering superior visual fidelity and performance in supported games and applications. This makes them a preferred choice for users seeking cutting-edge graphics capabilities on Linux.\nEncoder Superiority: Nvidia’s NVENC (encoder) is widely regarded as superior to AMD’s VCE-based encoding solutions. This advantage is crucial for professionals relying on robust hardware video encoding capabilities, where Nvidia’s NVENC outperforms AMD’s offerings.\nChallenges with nVidia GPUs # Although Nvidia has these significant advantages over AMD, it also faces its own set of challenges:\nSetup Complexity: Setting up Nvidia drivers on Linux can be intricate, especially with newer kernel versions. Compatibility issues may arise, necessitating manual configuration and occasional troubleshooting for optimal performance. Despite recent updates enhancing Wayland support, Nvidia’s settings control panel remains non-functional on Wayland, contrasting with ongoing improvements in AMDGPU Linux graphics drivers. Conclusion: Making the Right Choice # Choosing between AMD Radeon and Nvidia RTX GPUs on Linux boils down to your specific needs and priorities:\nGaming and Budget: If gaming performance and budget-friendly options are your main concerns, AMD Radeon GPUs offer compelling choices with good open-source driver support and competitive pricing.\nProfessional Applications: For professionals needing CUDA support for applications like DaVinci Resolve or extensive machine learning tasks, Nvidia RTX GPUs provide superior performance and reliability, albeit with a more complex setup process.\nFuture Prospects: AMD’s continuous improvement with open-source drivers and updates like ROCm 6.0.x suggest promising developments for broader compatibility and performance gains. Nvidia’s established dominance in CUDA and advanced features ensures robust support for demanding professional workflows.\nIn conclusion, whether you lean towards AMD Radeon for its open-source ethos and gaming prowess or Nvidia RTX for CUDA-driven performance and advanced graphics capabilities, understanding these nuances is crucial for making an informed decision on your next GPU purchase for Linux.\nData Links # Since I do not have the hardware myself to test and provide the data some of you out there might want to look at, below are some relevant links.\nAMD vs nVidia Gaming Benchmarks Nvidia vs AMD: GPUs in Machine Learning Nvidia nVenc vs AMD VCE ","date":"30 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/nvidia-vs-amd-linux/","section":"FOSS Posts","summary":"Disclaimer # I\u0026rsquo;ve gathered some relevant information for you below, which I hope you\u0026rsquo;ll find useful.

When you change root to another directory you cannot access files and commands outside that directory. This directory is called a “chroot jail”. Changing root is commonly done for system maintenance for such tasks as reinstalling GRUB or resetting a forgotten password. Changing root is often done from a LiveCD or LiveUSB into a mounted partition that contains an installed system.\nRequirements # You’ll need to boot to another working Linux environment (for example, to a LiveCD or USB flash disk). Root privileges are required in order to chroot. Be sure that the architectures of the Linux environment you have booted into matches the architecture of the root directory you wish to enter (i.e. i686, x86_64). You can find the architecture of your current environment by: uname -m If you need any kernel modules loaded in the chroot environment, load them before chrooting. It may also be useful to initialize your swap (swapon /dev/\u0026lt;device-or-partition-name\u0026gt;) and to connect to your network before chrooting. Mounting the device # The device or partition with the Linux system on it will need to be mounted. To discover the kernel name of the storage device name, type:\nfdisk -l Create a directory where you would like to mount the device or partition, then mount it:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/xero sudo mount /dev/device_or_partition_name /mnt/xero For LUKS encrypted devices, mount won’t work, use udisksctl instead, first unlock the device (all commands as regular user):\nsudo udisksctl unlock -b /dev/device_or_partition_name Get the device mapper name:\nls - la /dev/mapper then mount the returned mapper:\nudiskctl mount -b /dev/mapper/mapper_name Changing Root # Mount the temporary filesystems:\ncd /mnt/xero sudo mount -t proc proc proc/ sudo mount -t sysfs sys sys/ sudo mount -o bind /dev dev/ Mount other parts of your filesystem (e.g. /boot, /var, /usr…) that reside on separate partitions but which you need access to. For example:\nsudo mount /dev/device_or_partition_name boot/ It’s possible to mount filesystems after you’ve chrooted, but it’s more convenient to do so beforehand. The reasoning for this is you’ll have to unmount the temporary filesystems after you exit a chroot so this lets you unmount all the filesystems in a single command. This also allows a safer shutdown. Because the external Linux environment knows all mounted partitions it can safely unmount them during shutdown.\nIf you’ve setup your network and want to use it in the chroot environment, copy over your DNS servers so that you will be connected to the network:\ncp -L /etc/resolv.conf etc/resolv.conf Now chroot to your installed device or partition and define your shell:\nsudo chroot . /bin/bash If you see the error, chroot: cannot run command '/bin/bash': Exec format error it is likely the two architectures do not match.\nIf you’ll be doing anything with GRUB inside the chroot environment, you’ll need to be sure your /etc/mtab is up-to-date:\nsudo rm /etc/mtab \u0026amp;\u0026amp; grep -v rootfs /proc/mounts \u0026gt; /etc/mtab If you use bash, your root $HOME/.bashrc will be sourced on login provided your ~/.bash_profile specifies it (source ~/.bashrc). To source your chrooted, global bash configuration do:\nsource /etc/profile If your bash configuration doesn’t use a unique prompt, consider creating one to be able to differentiate your chroot environment:\nexport PS1=\u0026#34;(chroot) $PS1\u0026#34; Perform System Maintenance # At this point you can perform whatever system maintenance you require inside the chroot environment, some common examples being:\nUpgrade or downgrade packages Rebuild your initcpio image Reset a forgotten password Fix your /etc/fstab Reinstall GRUB With this information, you are able to arch-chroot, and to be able to do that you need to have root permissions, so type the following command:\nThen type the following:\nsudo arch-chroot /mnt/xero Now you’ve chrooted into your installed system, and you are able to access your files, install packages, or alter scripts to rescue your system.\nTo make sure arch-chroot is working check after your users home folder ls /home that should give your username from the installed system.\nExiting chroot # When you’re finished with system maintenance, exit the chroot shell:\nexit Then unmount the temporary filesystems and any mounted devices:\numount {proc,sys,dev,boot...} Finally attempt to unmount your hard drive:\ncd ..umount xero/ If you get an error saying that \u0026lsquo;/mnt\u0026rsquo; (or any other partition) is busy, this can mean one of two things:\nA program was left running inside of the chroot. Or more frequently: a sub-mount still exists. For example, /mnt/xero/usr within /mnt/xero. In the latter case, unmount the sub-mount mount point first. To get a reminder of all the current mount points, run mount with no parameters. If you still are unable to unmount a partition, use the force option:\numount -f /mnt After this you will be able to safely reboot.\n","date":"27 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/chroot-guide/","section":"FOSS Posts","summary":"Info # Changing Root (Chroot) is the process of changing of the apparent disk root directory (and the current running process and its children) to another root directory.

Hopefully a video showing it in action soon. In this short tutorial we will be using the Docker Compose feature to deploy our containers. Just note we can do so much more, but this is just an introductory guide, you will have to discover the rest on your own. It\u0026rsquo;s so much fun trust me. To get an idea how much I love them click Here to read my thoughts\u0026hellip;\nSo without further delay let\u0026rsquo;s gooooooooo\u0026hellip;\nWhat are Docker containers ? # Docker containers are lightweight, portable units that package an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent performance across different environments. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host OS kernel, making them more efficient and faster to start.\nKey Points: # Isolation: Containers run in isolated environments, using the host system’s resources without interference. Portability: Containers can be run anywhere with Docker installed, solving the \u0026ldquo;it works on my machine\u0026rdquo; issue. Efficiency: They use fewer resources than VMs since they don’t need a full OS for each instance. Consistency: Ensures the same environment across development, testing, and production. Scalability: Easily scalable with tools like Kubernetes, perfect for microservices. How It Works: # Dockerfile: Script defining how to build a Docker image. Build: Create an image from the Dockerfile. Run: Start a container from the image. Manage: Use Docker commands to handle the container lifecycle. Docker containers streamline development, improve resource utilization, and simplify deployment, making them ideal for modern application development.\nInstall Docker Package # Before we can deploy our container(s) we will need to install docker and its dependencies then enable the service. To do so type this in terminal (ArchLinux) :\nsudo pacman -S docker docker-compose Now that we have Docker installed we will need to add ourselves to the Docker group and start the service. Do it like this :\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER sudo systemctl enable --now docker Docker Compose file (Stack) # Ok, now that everything\u0026rsquo;s set, we can go container hunting\u0026hellip; I would highly recommend sites like, SelfH or AwesomeSelfHosted. But for the sake of this tutorial, I will be showing you an example docker compose file from one of the services found there. I have selected FileBrowser (User : demo / Pass : demo)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the docker compose file contents. Just create a folder called \u0026ldquo;FileBrowser\u0026rdquo;, then inside it a file called \u0026ldquo;compose.yml\u0026rdquo; inside it paste the following :\nservices: filebrowser: image: hurlenko/filebrowser user: \u0026#34;1000:1000\u0026#34; ports: - 443:8080 volumes: - /\u0026lt;path-to-shared-folder\u0026gt;:/data - ./config:/config environment: - FB_BASEURL=/ restart: always Just make sure to change the \u0026ldquo;443\u0026rdquo; port to one you prefer without touching part to the right which is the internal Docker one. Also in the \u0026ldquo;Volumes\u0026rdquo; section change the \u0026ldquo;- /:/data\u0026rdquo; part, do not modify right side just the left, before the \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo;, and set it to what you want to share between your machines. DO NOT SHARE ROOT ! At least if you are going to make it public. If you want to keep it internal like me, do it if you so wish it\u0026rsquo;s up to you.\nNow save the file, and open Terminal inside the folder and run the following command to start it as a Daemon :\ndocker compose up -d If all was done correctly, you will now be able to access your newly created container via following URLs :\nhttp://localhost:443 (Same machine container is on) http://\u0026lt;server-ip\u0026gt;:443 (From other machines on same network) Updating Docker Images # Deploying them images (containers) is nice and all, but now we need to maintain them, as in make sure they are up-to-date. In order to do so, we need to navigate to their respective folders, open terminal there, and run the following commands (FileBrowser) :\ndocker compose down (Stop Container) docker compose pull (Pull in latest version) docker compose up -d (Start it up again) Note :\nKeep in mind that some containers might require us to delete them before grabbing new version. Make sure to read their instructions on that before going forward. I just used what works for our example. Not all Containers function the same way\u0026hellip;\nOther tools\u0026hellip; # Kindly note that there are other tools we could use to make deployment much simpler. I just haven\u0026rsquo;t used them in this guide so you can see how it all works. Tools that can be used are, Portainer and Dockge, among many others\u0026hellip;\nNginx Proxy \u0026amp; More\u0026hellip; # So far what we have done here, is deploy container for local access. If you want to access it outside your Network, well, for this you will have to own your own Domain name, set up Nginx Proxy manager, use Cloudflare and so on. But that\u0026rsquo;s for another day.

It downloads a .flatpakref file and then you’ll have to use the command line to install from the flatpakref file.\nIf you have to use the command line ultimately, it doesn’t make sense to download the flatpakref file.\nYou can make things better by using Flatline. It’s a Browser extension and it makes that Install button useful by converting it into appstream link.\nThis way, when you click on the Install button for any application on the Flathub website, it will ask you to open the link in an XDG application like the Software Center.\nGrab it for Firefox -\u0026gt; Firefox Add-on Grab it for Chromium Browsers -\u0026gt; Chrome Extension This also means that you should have Fltapak support integrated into the software center.\nManage Flatpak permissions graphically With Flatseal # Flatseal is a graphical utility to review and modify your Flatpak applications’ permissions. This makes things a lot easier than going through the commands.\nIt lists all the installed Flatpak applications and shows what kind of permissions the selected application has.\nYou may enable or disable the permissions. Please bear in mind that disabling some permissions might impact the normal functioning of the application. You should know what you are doing.\nApply GTK system themes to Flatpak applications # You might have already noticed that most Flatpak apps don’t change their appearance as per the current system theme.\nWhy? Because Flatpak apps run inside a ‘container’ and don’t have access to the host filesystem, network, or physical devices.\nYou can choose to install themes as Flatpak to solve this issue. However, your favorite theme might not be available in Flatpak format.\nAlternatively, you can make some manual effort and force the Flatpak applications to use a given theme. Check This Thread to know more\u0026hellip;\nUpdate Flatpak apps and clean them # This is more for Flatpak unfriendly distributions like Ubuntu. If your distro doesn’t come baked in with Flatpak and you don’t have it integrated with the Software center, your installed Flatpak apps won’t be updated with system updates.\nYou can update all your installed Flatpak apps simultaneously with:\nflatpak update Conclusion # Flatpak should be the one and only method to deliver apps.

What\u0026rsquo;s that ? Well, an AUR helper is a tool that automates the process of installing and managing packages from the Arch User Repository (AUR) on Arch Linux. The main purpose of AUR helpers is to simplify the installation and updating of AUR packages, which are not available in the official Arch Linux repositories\nWhat is the difference between the two ? # The primary differences between the AUR helpers Yay and Paru lie in their underlying programming languages and some of their default settings and features. Yay is written in Go, while Paru is implemented in the more efficient Rust language, resulting in better performance. Additionally, Paru has some saner default settings, such as requiring users to review the PKGBUILD before installing a package, which is an important security consideration when working with the Arch User Repository. Yay, on the other hand, offers a unique \u0026ldquo;\u0026ndash;combinedupgrade\u0026rdquo; flag that provides a color-coded output to distinguish between repository and AUR package upgrades, a feature not present in Paru. In terms of active development, Paru is currently more actively maintained than Yay, though both continue to receive updates and improvements. The choice between the two ultimately comes down to personal preference and specific needs when managing packages from the AUR..\nYay Installation : # cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git cd ~/yay-bin/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; makepkg -rsi --noconfirm cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -Rf ~/yay-bin/ Yay Configuration : # yay -Y --devel --save \u0026amp;\u0026amp; yay -Y --gendb sed -i \u0026#39;s/\u0026#34;sudoloop\u0026#34;: false/\u0026#34;sudoloop\u0026#34;: true/\u0026#39; ~/.config/yay/config.json; Anyway here\u0026rsquo;s how to proceed for Paru\u0026hellip;\nParu Installation : # cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru-bin.git cd ~/paru-bin/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; makepkg -rsi --noconfirm cd ~ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -Rf ~/paru-bin/ Paru Configuration : # sudo sed -i -e \u0026#39;s/^#BottomUp/BottomUp/\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/^#SudoLoop/SudoLoop/\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/^#CombinedUpgrade/CombinedUpgrade/\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/^#UpgradeMenu/UpgradeMenu/\u0026#39; -e \u0026#39;s/^#NewsOnUpgrade/NewsOnUpgrade/\u0026#39; /etc/paru.conf echo \u0026#34;SkipReview\u0026#34; | sudo tee -a /etc/paru.conf \u0026gt; /dev/null paru --gendb; Closing # Once that is done, you can use it to start installing packages from the AUR.

I found a guide that I will be sharing with you all\u0026hellip;\nApps built with Q (aka KDE apps) do not look great on the XFCE4 \u0026amp; GNOME desktop because they don’t respect the default theme. The way to fix this is to use Kvantum. With it, you can set KDE app themes to use a similar theme to what you use.\nBefore we begin\u0026hellip; # In this guide, we’ll be using the Adapta GTK theme for XFCE. We’re focusing on Adapta because it has a Kvantum theme that is widely available and helps blend KDE apps in with XFCE4 quite well.\nBefore starting this guide, we highly recommend installing the Adapta GTK theme onto your Linux PC and enabling it as the default theme in XFCE.\nInstalling Kvantum on Linux # To get Kvantum working on your Linux PC, you will need to install it alongside the management tool. To get started, open up a terminal window and install the Kvantum manager, as well as everything else necessary to use it.\nArch Linux\nKvantum is available to Arch Linux users and has been for a very long time. There is an AUR package. There’s also a package in the official Arch Linux software sources, which we recommend.\nTo get the latest Kvantum on your Arch Linux PC, enter the following terminal command.\nsudo pacman -S kvantum Downloading Kvantum themes\nIn this guide, we’re focusing on the Kvantum Adapta theme. However, if you want to use a different GTK theme and need a matching Kvantum theme to go with it, the best place to go is the KDE Store.\nThe KDE Store has tons of stuff to download, including Kvantum theme engine themes. To download a Kvantum theme, head over to the Kvantum page on the KDE store. From there, look through the latest themes to download.\nOnce you’ve downloaded a theme, launch Kvantum Manager, select “Install/Update Theme,” and install it. Then, select “Change/Delete Theme” to start using it on your system.\nUsing Kvantum to make KDE apps look better # To make your KDE apps look better on the XFCE4 desktop, start by launching “Kvantum Manager” from the app menu. If you cannot find it in the app menu, open up the XFCE4 quick launcher with Alt + F2, and enter “kvantummanager” in the launch box.\nOnce the Kvantum Manager app is open on the XFCE4 desktop, follow the step-by-step instructions outlined below.\n- Step 1: Locate the “Change/Delete Theme” option in the Kvantum Manager. If you cannot find it, it is directly below the “Install/Update Theme.”\nAfter selecting the “Change/Delete Theme” button, you will see a menu that says “Select a theme,” followed by a blank text box. Change it to “Kvdapta.”\n- Step 2: Open up a terminal window and install the Qt5ct app.\nsudo pacman -S qt5ct - Step 3: Open up a terminal window and use the echo command to edit the profile file to add the environmental variable.\necho \u0026#34;export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.profile - Step 4: Log out of your XFCE 4 session and log back in.\n- Step 5: Open up Qt5ct via the app menu. Or, launch it via the terminal with the qt5ct command.\nStep 6: Locate the “Appearance” tab. Then, find the “Style” menu. In the menu, select “kvantum.” Then, select “Apply” to apply changes.\nUpon applying your changes, KDE applications on XFCE 4 should be using the Kvantum theme set up earlier. This method works the same way on both XFCE \u0026amp; GNOME.\nGuide by: AddictiveTips.com\n","date":"27 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/theme-qt-apps-on-gtk-de/","section":"FOSS Posts","summary":"Intro # As I was working on XFCE \u0026amp; Gnome, I noticed that since they both use GTK3/4, some Qt apps made for KDE like KdenLive did not follow the system theme.","title":"Make KDE apps use System theme in XFCE/Gnome","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"27 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/manager/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Manager","type":"tags"},{"content":" What is it? # Our good friend from ML4W just posted a video showing us how to have both Plasma 6 and Hyprland side-by-side with his awesome dotfiles..

Convert to Markdown: The script uses the markdownify library to convert the HTML content to Markdown and processes embedded YouTube videos. Save to File: The script saves each converted post to its own Markdown file. The filenames are derived from the thread IDs in the URLs. Output Directory: The script creates an output_dir directory if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist and saves the Markdown files there. How to Run the Script # Save the Script: Copy the script into a file named forum_to_markdown.py. Make sure you mark script as executable via chmod +x forum_to_markdown.py Run the Script: Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal: python forum_to_markdown.py This script will output each post to its own Markdown file in the markdown_posts directory.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it for now.

This makes the applications look out of the place in your otherwise beautiful set up.\nThe official way to apply GTK themes to Flatpak apps is by installing the desired theme as a flatpak. However, there are only a few GTK themes that can be installed as Flatpak.\nThis means that if you found a beautiful GTK theme, your Flatpak applications will still be using their default appearance. But wait! There is a workaround.\nTutorial # In this tutorial, I am going to introduce you a way to make Flatpak apps aware of external GTK themes.\nTo enable this functionality, users need to install the GTK themes similar to the one used in KDE (as for other distros) but also run these commands:\n- Step 1: Give Flatpak apps access to GTK themes location\nGTK themes are located in /usr/share/themes for all users, and in ~/.themes for a specific user. Notice that you can’t give access to /usr/share/themes because according to Flatpak Documentation they are blacklisted.\nSo, since all included GTK Themes in XeroLinux are located under /usr/share/themes which Flatpaks cannot access we need to copy them to ~/.themes .\nOnce that is done, to give all flatpak packages permission to access ~/.themes run the following command:\nsudo flatpak override --filesystem=$HOME/.themes - Step 2: Enable System-Wide Flatpak Override\nNow we need to apply a system-wide override telling Flatpaks to use whatever GTK theme system is using, it will be applied by default on next release of XeroLinux if it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been already..\nCommands :\nsudo flatpak override --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0:ro sudo flatpak override --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-4.0:ro Also sometimes that alone might not work, so you will need to set specific theme via\u0026hellip;\nsudo flatpak override org.gnome.Calculator --env=GTK_THEME=name-of-gtk-theme Once that\u0026rsquo;s done you will end up with a file in the system that includes those values. Seemingly enough there is some info about that exact issue on the Flathub iisue reporter..\nAs you can see in the screenshot below, there is two themes available, Ant-Bloody and Orchis-dark. Copy and paste the exact theme name in the above command:\nThis only applies to GTK3/4 based packages, for QT in most cases nothing needs to be done Wink Here\u0026rsquo;s the Original Thread on Manjaro Forums\u0026hellip; Oh and This Thread Too\u0026hellip;.\n","date":"27 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/flatpak-theming/","section":"FOSS Posts","summary":"Intro # One of the reasons why some users avoid installing Flatpak apps is that most Flatpak apps don’t change their appearance as per the current system theme.

After some research I stumbled upon an AiO Installer Script by the famous TKG\u0026hellip;\nWhat is it? # What that script does is actually very simple, it gives the you, the user, an option to install various versions of the nVidia drivers.

Installs for all currently installed kernels. Comes with custom patches to enhance kernel compatibility, dynamically applied when you\u0026rsquo;re requesting a driver that\u0026rsquo;s not compatible OOTB with your currently installed kernel(s). Unwanted packages can be disabled with switches in the PKGBUILD. Defaults to complete installation.\nDKMS or regular? # DKMS is recommended as it allows for automatic module rebuilding on kernel updates. As long as you\u0026rsquo;re on the same major version (5.8.x for example), you won\u0026rsquo;t need to regenerate the packages on updates, which is a huge QoL feature. Regular modules can also be problematic on Manjaro due to differences in kernel hooking mechanisms compared to Arch. So if in doubt, go DKMS.\nFrogging GitHUB # Well, now that you know more click the button below to get teleported to his GitHub where you will find more info and instructions on how to build and install the drivers.\nFrogging-Family/nvidia-all Nvidia driver latest to 396 series AIO installer Shell 706 60 Useful or a dud? # I hope this discovery helps you fix them issues.

People have asked me many times what USB tool I use to make bootable Linux drives. Well that should answer that question.\nBut before I dive deeper into the why I use it over others here some info to get started.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Ventoy exactly? # Ventoy creates bootable USB devices using ISO images. That sounds an awful lot like what established programs such as Rufus do at first, but when you realize that it puts the ISO images on the drive and does not extract them, it becomes interesting.\nEven better, it is possible to place multiple ISO images on the USB device after it has been prepared by Ventoy; this allows you to boot into different Linux systems or install different versions of Windows straight from a single USB device.\nVentoy even supports Secure Boot. Other than that it also includes support for changing the filesystem of the first partition (ntfs/udf/xfs/ext2/ext3/ext4), persistence support for various Linux distributions such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint, and support for auto-installation.\nTheme Support # Also, since it uses GRUB, naturally, you can theme it. Yes, you read that correctly, it uses Grub themes, so if there’s a theme you like and use, you can apply it to Ventoy. This tool is my go-to as I have so many ISOs and it saves me time and frustration of having to flash a 2GB ISO on one of my 128GB thumb drives wasting space in the process.\nI absolutely love this thing. It’s actively being updated. Adding more features, fixing others, and baking in support for more Distros. Just make sure to update the USB stick after updating the app itself, because updating the app alone does not magically update USB. You will have to do that yourself via a small terminal command. Click button below to visit the site and read documentation.\nNote: Ventoy is available as an optional tool in XeroLinux, so no need to download from the official site, or if you are on a different Arch-based distro just grab it from AUR otherwise I think it’s available on Debian repos.\nHow to get it ? # Well, there are multiple way to grab this awesome tool, but since we mostly target ArchLinux over here I will let you know how to get it for this specific Distro. Below is the link to their Github page, but don\u0026rsquo;t get it from there just yet.\nventoy/Ventoy A new bootable USB solution.

In the old days, you might upgrade certain pieces of software, but mostly you would wait until you bought the next version of your distro of choice. Then you’d install it and marvel at the upgraded software.\nPackage management systems have made this easy, but they can’t update every part of your system. What about Ruby Gems or packages you installed via a third-party package manager like Linuxbrew? How will you keep your configuration files synced?\nWhat Is Topgrade ? # You can get a clue of just what Topgrade is meant to do by looking at its GitHub page. Its slogan, written at the top of the page, is “upgrade everything.” That’s exactly what it is meant to do.\nWhile we’re focusing on Linux here, Topgrade also works on macOS and Windows. Topgrade is written in Rust, so it should be rather speedy. It’s also licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0, so it’s free as in libre, not just free of charge.\nWhat Does Topgrade Update ? # On Linux it will upgrade your system via its package manager, but that’s just the beginning. It will also upgrade Ruby Gems, Atom packages, Linuxbrew and nix packages, and more. It also upgrades apps installed via Snap or Flatpak. This is far from everything, but it should give you an idea.\nTopgrade can also upgrade a large portion of your configuration files. It will upgrade your Vim or Neovim configuration if you use NeoBundle, Vundle, Plug, or Dein. If you use a Git repository for your dotfiles, it will also pull any recent changes to them.\nYou can also add custom commands for Topgrade to run while upgrading. This is handy if you use some custom scripts you’d like to keep automatically updated.\nInstalling Topgrade # If you run Vanilla Arch, Topgrade is available via the AUR package. Fortunately, this is fairly easy. On XeroLinux, you can install it with the following commands:\nparu -S topgrade-bin Using Topgrade # Now that Topgrade is installed, keeping your system up to date is easy. To run Topgrade’s basic update steps, just run the command:\ntopgrade If you want to add some custom commands or tweak how Topgrade works, you’ll need to edit its configuration file. On Linux, this is located at ~/.config/topgrade.toml For example, if you have a list of Git repositories you’d like to refresh, add the following to the file:\ngit-repos = [ \u0026#34;~/my-repos/repo_name\u0026#34;, ] For more information on tweaking the configuration file, see the Customization section on the Topgrade GitHub page below.\ntopgrade-rs/topgrade Upgrade all the things Rust 1685 115 Conclusion # Topgrade gives you a ton of power when it comes to keeping your system up to date.

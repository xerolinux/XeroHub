So sit back, grab a cup of tea/coffee and read on. It&amp;rsquo;s under this category coz it simply isn&amp;rsquo;t related to Linux.&lt;/p>


&lt;h3 class="relative group">Back Story 
 &lt;div id="back-story" class="anchor">&lt;/div>
 
 &lt;span
 class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100">
 &lt;a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700"
 style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#back-story" aria-label="Anchor">#&lt;/a>
 &lt;/span> 
 
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I want to talk about project&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>YouTube Channel&lt;/strong>. I know I talked about it a few times before, but this time it&amp;rsquo;s not personal. Far from it, it&amp;rsquo;s just to update everyone on the situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with how it all started. As I was working on the now discontinued &lt;strong>XeroLinux&lt;/strong> Distro, someone asked me if I could create a channel where I documented everything. At first I hesitated, due to the lack of knowledge there, and being camera shy, which am not anymore as you saw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First few videos did not have my face, but slowly I started to appear in a few until it became the norm. I kept experimenting with a few setups still did until today. Was never satisfied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did not know what type of content to bring you guys, and getting monetization status was hard, until I met Alex from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thelinuxtube/videos" target="_blank">&lt;strong>TheLinuxTube&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> channel, who introduned me to someone who helped me get there and fast. But sadly, even with that status, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting enough views to profit from it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I get it, it&amp;rsquo;s not your fault, but it was more related to the type of content I was making, mostly related to &lt;strong>ArchLinux&lt;/strong> and my project. I even attempted to to host a podcast, and interview well-known Content Creators, which I failed miserably.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did that for a while, then stopped. I came back for a while, thinking that&amp;rsquo;s it am on a roll now, with a video every Wednesday, and a Live at the end of every month. But alas, that did not work in my favor as much as I wanted it to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>


&lt;h3 class="relative group">Present &amp;amp; Future 
 &lt;div id="present--future" class="anchor">&lt;/div>
 
 &lt;span
 class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100">
 &lt;a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700"
 style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#present--future" aria-label="Anchor">#&lt;/a>
 &lt;/span> 
 
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Which brings me to the present. You will no longer see any videos from me for now. That&amp;rsquo;s it, I do apologize for that. It&amp;rsquo;s also that creating videos has affected my mental health negatively for little gain and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to recover from that. Fear not though, channel isn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere, I will be leaving it up, in case you find a video that helps you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for the future of the channel, well I do not know. Maybe one day, if and when I settle down, with a decent job that actually makes me money to grab the required equipment, take care of some lingering health/appearance issues, I might consider coming back.&lt;/p>


&lt;h3 class="relative group">Blogging 
 &lt;div id="blogging" class="anchor">&lt;/div>
 
 &lt;span
 class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100">
 &lt;a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700"
 style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#blogging" aria-label="Anchor">#&lt;/a>
 &lt;/span> 
 
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As you might have noticed, lately I have been concentrating on written content. It brings me more joy, more freedom to express myself, and most importantly I get to share more tools and guides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only thing you will not see from me are Distro Reviews, Vs and Bechmarking posts. Why ? Well quite simply because I lack the tools, hardware for benchmarking, and prefer not to start dramas when it comes to Distro Reviews and Vs posts, because as I have noticed lately, the &lt;strong>FOSS&lt;/strong> community tends to be strongly opinionated, and sees &lt;em>Favoritism&lt;/em> where there is none. I will leave those kinds of posts to those who like to do them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also I think that written content tends to be more useful than videos, simply because in case of commands to be run, paths to be used etc, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to copy and paste rather than pause the video and type them manually. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that videos are not useful, on the contrary, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for them, posts would be stale and boring, that&amp;rsquo;s why in my humble opinion, they compliment written content, helping us include a showcase of the product we are talking about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, from now on, and for the foreseeable future I will be concentrating on what I love most, which is blogging. I have so much to share, so little time as the saying goes lol&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>


&lt;h3 class="relative group">The other blog 
 &lt;div id="the-other-blog" class="anchor">&lt;/div>
 
 &lt;span
 class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100">
 &lt;a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700"
 style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#the-other-blog" aria-label="Anchor">#&lt;/a>
 &lt;/span> 
 
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Oh, I forgot to mention the &lt;a href="https://blog.xerolinux.xyz" target="_blank">&lt;strong>Other Blog&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, well, since am enjoying written content, I thought I would also start a personal &lt;em>Journal&lt;/em>, where I document how I feel about different things in the land of &lt;strong>FOSS&lt;/strong> and my projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I keep it separate from this site, so as to not litter it with personal feelings as it were. That kind of content has no place here. I made it publicly available, so you can join me on my quest so to say. If you don&amp;rsquo;t care for that kind of content, by all means don&amp;rsquo;t go there. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of lows with a bit of highs.. Simply coz that&amp;rsquo;s how I feel right now. Hoping for more positivity in the near future- (knock on wood).&lt;/p>


&lt;h3 class="relative group">Closing words 
 &lt;div id="closing-words" class="anchor">&lt;/div>
 
 &lt;span
 class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100">

 style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#closing-words" aria-label="Anchor">#&lt;/a>
 &lt;/span> 
 
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I know this might be a lot to take in. I just felt like sharing an update regarding the channel, and by extension the present and future state of affairs here at the &lt;strong>XeroLinux HQ&lt;/strong>. I hope I did not bore you to death lol.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anywho, thanks for reading all this, looking forward to your thoughts on the matter over on &lt;a href="https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux" target="_blank">&lt;strong>Fosstodon&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

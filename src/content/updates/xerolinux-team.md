### Meet the XeroLinux Dream Team!

At the helm stands [**DarkXero**](https://github.com/DarkXero-dev), the ideas volcano, lead maintainer, and Lord of the distro, constantly erupting with bold concepts like toolkit overhauls and seamless Arch workflows, then wrangling the chaos into polished perfection through sheer grit and vision.

[**Synse**](https://github.com/synsejse/) & [**kyvran**](https://github.com/kyvran) are the dev ninjas deep in the trenches, hand-crafting and relentlessly perfecting our core toolkit *plus* other essential tools from scratch. They plunge into code depths with debug katanas, annihilating bugs via endless `gdb` sessions and ironclad test suites—ensuring your Plasma tweaks, install scripts, and custom goodies execute flawlessly on everything from vintage ThinkPads to modern beasts, zero crashes allowed.

Holding down Discord fort: **inittux111**, mod maestro who smoothly onboards noobs with pro Arch guides while slinging meme shields at spam armies. **NatFetch** & [**TheLegit**](https://www.twitch.tv/techben10) rule as admin overlords, fortress-hardening servers, dropping stunning neofetch ASCII art, and igniting epic events, from ISO drop parties to marathon debug fests that crack the toughest nuts.

Finally, there's [**Digidude512**](https://www.reddit.com/user/digidude512/) our resident ISO builder and uploader extraordinaire, churning out fresh, lightning-fast builds and zipping them to mirrors worldwide—making sure you grab the latest **XeroLinux** goodness with a single click.

That's your **XeroLinux** crew, a perfect blend of vision, code mastery, and community fire.

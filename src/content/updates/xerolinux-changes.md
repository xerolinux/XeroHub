### Thank you

I want to sincerely thank each and every one of you here and beyond for all the support you’ve shown. Many of you have become true friends outside the Linux realm, and I deeply appreciate every one of you.

Our Discord server, while less active than some others, is wonderful just the way it is. It’s a perfect space, free from drama, hate, and, most importantly, judgment. That’s exactly how it should be. As for our community as a whole, I am continually impressed by how calm and mature it is, truly one of the best out there. I am genuinely surprised and grateful. Thank you all.

### The Changes

**XeroLinux** is currently in the process of shedding some extra weight, but don’t worry, the project as a whole isn’t going anywhere. In fact, things will be changing for the better, I assure you. While we will be losing a few scripts, they will be replaced with new and improved ones that enhance the overall experience.

Additionally, we will be discontinuing the **Gnome ISO** (will continue to function just no more ISOs) and dropping support for other distros to streamline our efforts. I am doing this so I can focus more on the most important aspect—stability—without spreading myself too thin. This project is not about quantity but quality, hence why there will be no more spins, not now not ever, so please do not request any. This refocusing will ensure it continues to thrive as the distro I have always wanted.

That’s why, from this point forward, there will only be one version: the KDE version. It’s simply because KDE is the desktop environment I love, flaws and all. It’s a bit like a marriage, committed for the long haul, “til death do us part.” Alongside this change, the Discord server will undergo some minor adjustments as well.

Please don’t be shocked if you notice channels being moved or deleted; these changes are meant to keep things organized and focused as we continue to grow and improve. Your understanding and support mean a lot during this transition. 

### The future

As for what the future holds, it is a story yet to be written, unfolding step by step as we move forward together. With every challenge we face and every milestone we reach, we shape a path filled with growth and opportunities. I truly believe that things will only get better from here, thanks to the support and encouragement of all of you who have been a part of this journey.

Your trust and dedication inspire us every day, and together, there’s no limit to what we can achieve.

## Intro

We’re super excited to share that **XeroLinux** is moving ahead! soon you will be able to try out **Free Demo** version.

Yup, you read that right. It’s a way for you to get a feel for the distro and all its cool features before deciding to support us by donating for the *full, unlocked ISO*. Wondering if there’s a catch? Keep reading...

## How & Why

Lately, I’ve been getting a bunch of requests to offer a free version so people can test drive the distro — kind of like a *try before you buy*. That got me thinking: how do I do that without folks just grabbing the free version and ignoring the paid one?

Initially, I wrote [**this guide**](https://bytes.xerolinux.xyz/posts/try-before-buy/) on how to do it. But more feedback came in, with people saying stuff like “Why should we do all the hard work ourselves?”

So, what next? Last night, during the **DistroTube** Patron Cast, someone suggested something brilliant: why not make a *Demo* ISO without the installer? Lightbulb moment! I couldn’t believe I hadn’t thought of it before. So I jumped right in and made it happen.

<div style="position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7AtsbVUQzGg" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0;" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

The demo ISO won’t include the installer or the toolkit, which means you can’t install the OS from them. Plus, I’ve limited the *cow-space* to 100MiB — so you won’t be able to update or install big packages. They’re just for testing, so don’t try updating, it won’t work because of the space limit.

These demo ISO is now available for download on the main page. Enjoy !

## Conclusion

We’re really excited to offer this **Free Demo ISO** as a way for everyone to try out **XeroLinux** without any risk. It’s all about giving you a hands-on experience so you can see what the distro is all about before deciding to support the project by getting the full, unlocked versions.

We hope this approach strikes the perfect balance between sharing our work and encouraging contributions. To know more about what's included as well as limitations, check [**this post**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/distro/#free-demo-isos)

And as always, thanks for being part of the **XeroLinux** community!

Cheers !

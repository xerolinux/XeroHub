description: The Gear I use
info:
  - "Some people call me an **Arch** & **KDE Plasma** shill, and I don't see the problem with that. I use what works for me, and **Arch** has been great. Sure, there are issues, but none have been deal-breakers for my use case. I've tried other distros, but **Arch** is the one I can easily adapt to and fix when problems arise."
  - "Just wanted to cover these facts before moving on with the Hardware & Software I use..."
hardwareIntro: "I do own many, 3 Desktops, 2 Laptops and a Mini PC. Main, NAS, Home-Lab & HTPC. Laptops are unimportant just runs my shop and testing various Distros."

    description: "Main rig, the one I do all my *Development*, *Gaming* and other things on. It was recently upgraded to an `RX 7800XT` and a `Ryzen 9 5950X`. I now use **KDE Wayland** on the daily. I am enjoying it so much better now."

    description: "This Mini PC, as the name implies, was my **Home-Lab** PC, it used to run all my **Docker Containers** as well as my **Proxmox** server. It has `32GB RAM` after upgrade, with a `Ryzen 5 7530U`. That thing is not showing any signs of slowing down. It's a great little machine. But alas now it is my XeroLinux project storage system, where I store all my files and I use it when I travel to work on XeroLinux."
  - name: XeroNAS
    subtitle: "NAS/Storage"

    description: "My **NAS** PC, it stores all my personal data as well as my Linux ISOs & GOG game installers. It has `8GB RAM` with a `Ryzen 5 3600X` and an old `GTX 650 Ti Boost-OC` GPU. Running [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org) for managing all the storage. It ain't much but it works."

    description: "Used in the office, with `1Tb nVme`, a `Ryzen 5 PRO 4650U`, `16Gb RAM` and an iGPU. I mainly use this thing for testing other Distros and configs. It never stays on the same OS longer than a month or two. It will never see **Windows** mark my words. It's the most **Linux** friendly laptop on the market today..."

    - "Now I do have a few other systems that I don't use much if at all, just sitting here collecting dust as decorative pieces. An old **MacBook Pro** from 2016, yeah the one with the faulty butterfly keyboard n thouchbar. I barely use that thing relegated to a shelf somewhere."
    - "Finally I have the awesome **SteamDeck**, yep I managed to snag one. It's now my *Retro Gaming Console* with [Batocera](/posts/retro-deck/) running the show. I absolutely love it ! Sadly I no longer have the time to use it, so it's now sitting behind my monitors teasing me lol ;)"
thanks: "That's it folks. Now you have a better idea of what equipment I use on a daily basis to bring you everything I do. I did not list all the softwares I use coz it's a long list that varies a lot. Thanks for reading."

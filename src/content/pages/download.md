Welcome to the official **XeroLinux** download page. If you're just getting started, the **ISO** is your best bet, it comes with the **Calamares** GUI installer, which makes setup a breeze, while still giving you full control over manual drive partitioning. It's available through a small donation. This isn't a paywall or a demand, but a humble ask. If you find value in this project, your support goes a long way in keeping this project alive and actively developed. It also helps me weather the ongoing economic crisis here in **Lebanon**. Every bit counts, and I truly appreciate it.

However, if you are unable to donate, I understand. The **T.U.I installer** gives you the same full **XeroLinux** experience through a much simplified and user-friendly terminal-based setup, completely free. Both paths lead to the same destination.
